I've only eaten nutella and peanut butter together on graham crackers or scooped on a spoon, but I have yet to bake something that has both nut butters in it. Maybe this recipe will be a first! Especially since the description reads, "chewy, soft & fudgy". That for me, is the description of the ultimate brownie. Actually, add the word "rich" in there. Now there you have it!
