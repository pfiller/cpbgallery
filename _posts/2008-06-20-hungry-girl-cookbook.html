<a href="http://book.hungry-girl.com/">Hungry Girl: Recipes and Survival Strategies for Guilt-Free Eating in the Real World</a> by Lisa "Hungry Girl" Lillien has some pretty fantastic looking recipes in it. With a small apartment and a full bookshelf, I often toil about purchasing new cookbooks. Why clutter up my apartment when there's a plethora of new recipes constantly being released on the internet?

Because... I want to... that's why!

There's just something exciting about having a new cookbook. The glossy pages filled with gorgeous photos of mouthwatering dishes are pretty hard to resist, especially when the desserts within look as good as the above PB 'n Chocolate Bread Pudding Bonanza. 

Hungry girl's book also includes recipes for Dreamy Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge and a Peanut Butter Cup Milkshake. These recipes are part of a full chapter that's dedicated to chocolate. Now <em>that</em> is my kind of cookbook! She also claims the recipes are guilt-free which is a wonderful surprise because they certainly don't look like it.

While I'm not a person that will forgo dessert if it's high in calories, I am an advocate of portion control. I appreciate that she includes the nutritional value of the desserts because it won't totally discourage me from indulging, but it might make me trim my portion down from a full portion to a half. After all, healthy diets aren't about deprivation, they are about having control. And lord knows I need my dessert!
