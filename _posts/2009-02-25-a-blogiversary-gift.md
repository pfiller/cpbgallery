What better way to celebrate CPB's one year b-day than with some awards! I've seen cute little awards like these all over other people's blogs but have never received one myself. I am honored and humbled that <a href="http://sweettreatsdani.blogspot.com/2009/02/my-first-blog-awards.html">Sweet Treats Dani</a> chose me and am happy to spread the love to other blogs that I very much enjoy.

She's given me the <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tLEkZKy_lrE/SaA0kCItinI/AAAAAAAAAWs/3HU_Pr7XbD4/s1600-h/fabulous_blog_award.jpg">Fabulous Award</a> for being fabulous and the <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tLEkZKy_lrE/SaA0X76Q1XI/AAAAAAAAAWk/CxMGCFUz1C0/s1600-h/LemonadeAward.jpg">Lemonade Award</a> for liking lemonade... er... for being refreshing! Wooo!

I'm passing these fun awards on to the following:
<a href="http://thebakingbird.blogspot.com/">The Baking Bird</a>
<a href="http://www.bakedperfection.com/">Baked Perfection</a>
<a href="http://erincooks.com/">Erin Cooks</a>
<a href="http://www.happygomarni.com/">Happy Go Marni</a>
<a href="http://confectionarycreations.blogspot.com/">Confectionary Creations</a>

These five blogs are ones that I check on a regular basis and hope that you will too. I've found some awesome CPB treats on all of them like the <a href="http://www.happygomarni.com/2008/11/rachel-bar-aka-peanut-butter-ganache.html">Rachel Bar at Happy Go Marni</a> and this <a href="http://www.bakedperfection.com/2009/02/oreo-peanut-butter-cheesecake.html">Oreo Peanut Butter Cheesecake on Baked Perfection</a>.

To the recipients:
- Add the awards to your blog.
- Link to the person who gave you them.
- Nominate other refreshingly fabulous blogs you love (with their links).
- Leave a message for your nominees in their blogs, informing them about the award.
