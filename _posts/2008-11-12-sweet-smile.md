Did I say I was going to take a break from cupcakes for a while? I meant... after this post...

Seriously - how cute is that?

This pic almost looks like a frame of a stop animation film. I half expect the cupcake to come alive and sort of waddle it's way off the table and out the door, safely escaping from anyone who might be inclined to take a bite!

This is a great decorating idea for anyone who might be a bit intimidated to pick up a piping bag. Give this a try - it's easy... and of course, adorable!
