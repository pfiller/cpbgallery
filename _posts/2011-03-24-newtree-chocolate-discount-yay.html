<a href="http://www.newtree.com/page.php?p1=289&language=en-US">NewTree Chocolate Bars</a> have great soothing flavors like "Cocoon" (apricot) and "Tranquility" (lavendar). I like the names, but "Pleasure" (dark cocoa) seems almost redundant since I think it goes without say that chocolate provides pleasure. Then again, does it imply that this particular chocolate bar is <em>double</em> pleasureful? Hmmm...

Sounds like an answer worth seeking out, if you ask me! And conveniently enough, <a href="http://dailygourmet.com/offers/newtree-improve-your-mood-with-belgian-chocolate">Daily Gourmet</a> is sharing a discount for 34% off the retail price of these bars, with an additional $5 off for 5 of my lovely chocolate-peanut-butter-addicted readers.
