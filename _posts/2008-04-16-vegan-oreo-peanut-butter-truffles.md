It's been a while since I found something sweet and delicious for vegans, but boy did I find something for you this time. This Vegan Oreo Peanut Butter Truffle was made by flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pilliebee/">pilliebee</a>. Did I mention I have a horrible weakness to oreos? And we all know I have a bit of an everlasting chocolate peanut butter craving. So, these sound about perfect to me!

I suspect this truffle is larger in the photo than in person, but wouldn't it be fantastic if it was actually softball sized? I only wish I could see what it looks like in the middle. Of course this desire just gives me more reason to make them myself.
