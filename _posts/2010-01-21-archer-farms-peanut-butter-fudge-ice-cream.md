One of Taste Tester's favorite desserts is unquestionably ice cream, or more accurately: milkshakes. You may even remember that we went on a little quest last year to find <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/06/09/top-5-chocolate-peanut-butter-milkshakes/">the best chocolate peanut butter milkshakes</a> around. Well, like many people out there, we are trying to be a little more economical these days and have been trying to eat out a little less. This change applies to sweets as well, not just takeout. 

We slowly started weaning ourselves off frequent Cold Stone milkshakes and quickly got into <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/08/20/feelin-lovey-dovey-with-my-chubby-hubby/">Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby</a>. Because it's sold at the corner store just feet from our apartment, you can imagine that it was a frequent purchase. More recently though, I went out looking for another convenient option and came across <a href="http://www.target.com/Archer-Farms-Peanut-Butter-Fudge/dp/B00170FSGI">Archer Farm's Peanut Butter Fudge Ice Cream</a>.

I have come to like the few Archer Farm's products I've tried and decided to give it a whirl. It's pretty good for store-bought ice cream, though not quite as rich as Ben & Jerry's. The key is definitely to let it sit for a few minutes after taking it out of the freezer (though I guess that probably applies to all ice cream, right?). That way you can actually taste the chocolate and not just taste how cold it is. The best bites are definitely the ones with big hunks of peanut butter in them. I bet this flavor would be even better with a bit of caramel sauce drizzled over it. Mmm. It may not be quite as rich and deliciously unhealthy as our favorite chocolate peanut butter Cold Stone shake, but it's tasty enough to stifle the cravings.

I enjoyed the <a href="http://www.target.com/Archer-Farms-Peanut-Butter-Fudge/dp/B00170FSGI">reviews of this ice cream on the Target website</a> as 2 out of 4 of the reviewers are begging Target to make sure it stays well-stocked in their local store. One review went into a bit more detail about the flavor stating, "No annoying little peanut butter cups, no cloyingly sweet peanut butter. Just the simple sublime combination of rich roasted peanut butter and creamy cool chocolate ice cream." 

For a convenient fix that requires no time in the kitchen, pick up some of <a href="http://www.target.com/Archer-Farms-Peanut-Butter-Fudge/dp/B00170FSGI">Archer Farm's Peanut Butter Fudge Ice Cream</a> at your local Target and join me in accepting that it's okay to be lazy some of the time!
