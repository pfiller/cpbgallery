Have fun building up your sweets stash today! Remember to barter for chocolate peanut butter treats!

(Credit for this carving-a-Reeses idea goes to Taste Tester who saw it on a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi0OBcOR5tA">Reeses Halloween commercial</a>. Unfortunately it was so irresistible that our dog snuck into my photo area and ate it shortly after the shoot!)
