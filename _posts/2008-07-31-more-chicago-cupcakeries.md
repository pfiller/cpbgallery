The incredible Vegan Peanut Butter Cupcake posted above is from <a href="http://www.thebleedingheartbakery.com/index.php">The Bleeding Heart Bakery</a> in Chicago (from flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebleedingheartbakery/">The Bleeding Heart Bakery</a>). Drooling yet?

Taste Tester and I were only in Chicago for two days, and since we bought over a dozen cupcakes on <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/07/30/back-with-a-bang-a-review-of-mollys-cupcakes/">our visit to Molly's Cupcakes</a> we didn't get around to visiting the other cupcakeries on my list. I still wanted to mention them though and hopefully when I'm in town next time I'll get to stop in and see what they're baking up. You should too!

I've actually been to Bleeding Heart a couple of times before, but I've only been to their former Chicago Avenue location and have yet to visit their new spot - and taste their fabulous looking cupcakes. They have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebleedingheartbakery/sets/72157604060000661/">a set of photos on flickr</a> of various organic, gluten free and vegan flavors including that lovely looking Peanut Butter Cupcake in the above photo. If I am ever able to stop ogling that pic, I'll be sure to get out and pay them a visit.

We passed right by this bakery, but it was right after eating a full breakfast and it was a little too early in the day to be craving cupcakes. Because of this we didn't go in, though of course later in the day when the craving hit, the regret set in. They sell a chocolate cake with peanut butter buttercream and the photos on their site are pretty drool-worthy. I love the adorable bubbly flower design of their icing - their cupcakes look fun to eat.

This cupcakery claims to have "the best cupcakes anywhere!" so, I guess they're not modest, but with "over 150 flavors and counting," I guess they have right to be a little cocky. They even have dog cakes for your furry friend. It looks like they only post current flavors, which change weekly. They don't have any chocolate peanut butter cupcakes this week, but I assume at least one out of 150 would be made up of my beloved combination.

If you're not on a travel site booking a flight to Chicago yet, I don't know how else to convince you... yes, I know that cupcake looks amazing, but quit staring and get moving!
