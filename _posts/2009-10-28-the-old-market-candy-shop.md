To all of you who sent such nice comments on my last post: thanks for the enthusiasm - we are excited to get hitched!! :)

During our road trip, we spent a long weekend in Omaha, NE for a wedding and had an afternoon to wander around the Old Market neighborhood. It's a charming little area with cobblestone streets and lots of cute shops.

Of course, one of the first shops that I noticed was a fun little candy store called <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/old-market-candy-shop-omaha">The Old Market Candy Shop</a>.

Although everything in the chocolate case looked really good and the friendly woman behind the counter told us that they made most of their chocolates right there on premesis, we didn't buy a whole lot since we were heading to the Askinosie Chocolate Factory in Springfield, MO a few short days later. 

We still managed to purchase a few chocolates to hold us over, including "Crunchy Stuff" (milk chocolate coated mounds of rice krispies, peanuts and pretzels) and "Mud Balls" (a crushed oreo/cream cheese mixture coated in dark chocolate and garnished with chocolate sprinkles). We nearly laughed in the sweet woman's face when she gave us the total price because you could maybe buy one truffle in NY for the price of 4 there. It was a really pleasant surprise to us!

I was excited to take a bite of a Mud Ball right away, since they reminded me of Bakerella's much raved-about <a href="http://www.bakerella.com/category/pops-bites/cake-pops/">Cake Pops</a>.

Here's the magical dark chocolatey oreo inside. Mmmm. It was surprisingly creamy for being made up largely of crushed crunchy cookies. The filling was really dark and being an Oreo fanatic, they were right up my alley.

It quickly became evident that the few chocolates we left the store with were not enough, so we returned for a re-stock before leaving Omaha. We quickly devoured our second stash of chocolates before going to a chocolate factory. Do you think we have a problem? The shop sells plenty of chocolate peanut butter treats as well (including Peanut Butter Fluff Cups and Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge), so they can surely satisfy your sweet tooth's cravings. 

However, if you can't make it to Omaha and want to make your own Mud Balls at home, you can use this recipe from <a href="http://desertculinary.blogspot.com/2005/07/oreo-truffle-balls.html">Culinary in the Desert</a>. You could even try making a chocolate peanut butter version by using Nutter Butters instead of Oreos and coating them in chocolate!
