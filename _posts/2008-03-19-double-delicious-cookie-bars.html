The <a href="http://www.eaglebrand.com/">Eagle Family Foods</a> site may not be the first place you'd think to look for a chocolate peanut butter recipe, but they have some very easy and tasty ones. There are days when I feel like breaking out a recipe book that has gourmet concoctions that take three pages of instructions to make. However there are also plenty of days where I've gotten home late from work and would like to whip up a quick sweet treat to enjoy as I wind down from a long day. This is definitely a lazy day recipe for a comforting chocolate and peanut butter snack.

It's a graham cracker crust topped with a gooey layer of chocolate and peanut butter chips. I sprinkled a thin layer of oats on top for extra body and texture, and used bittersweet chips instead of semi-sweet.  In retrospect, I think using half milk, half bittersweet chips would have been better. It seems that milk chocolate would go really well with the caramel flavor from the condensed milk, while bittersweet would satiate my constant need for darker chocolate. Also it's really important to use good quality chocolate with a recipe like this that has so few ingredients, where chocolate is the star. I used <a href="http://www.ghirardelli.com/products/chips_bittersweet.aspx">Ghirardelli 60% Bittersweet Chips</a>.

Throw this together, sit down and enjoy!
