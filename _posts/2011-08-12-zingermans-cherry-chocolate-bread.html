Say hello to one of my favoritest birthday gifts ever!

Years ago, upon discovering it, I became instantly addicted to Zingerman's <a href="http://www.zingermans.com/Product.aspx?ProductID=B-CHO">Cherry Chocolate Bread</a>. It's got a beautiful firm crust and giant chunks of super dark chocolate that are intermingled with big tasty Michigan cherries. The price is a bit steep for bread, yes, but can you really put a price on chocolate-fueled happiness? If you can, thenâ€¦ what's wrong with you?

A few years after falling into deep chocolate-breadalicious love with Zingerman's, <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/08/05/visiting-zingermans-in-ann-arbor-michigan/">we visited their shops</a>. I was in heaven at the time but sadly, they're inconveniently located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and not in my east-coast apartment as preferred. The nerve! So despite my love, I've only been there that one glorious time.

Fortunately however, my very good food-minded friend <a href="http://www.kathleensconfections.com/">Kathy</a> was there this week and shipped me a super-fresh loaf of my favorite bread for my birthday! I was never so happy to see the mailman.

This bread is great plain, and it's especially great toasted in the toaster oven so the chocolate gets all melty and gooey. You slather it with a little unsalted butter and oh man!

But, inspired by the almond butter/chocolate/cherry combo in <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/caveman-diet-brownie-sundae">this paleo brownie recipe</a>, I decided to slather a slice of it in almond butter. After so many years of writing this blog, I like peanut butter on just about anything and it would be fine on this, but almond butter was definitely a better match for the cherries. Since my almond butter wasn't sweetened, a generous drizzle of honey rounded out the snack. And gave it an irresistibly sexy sheen.

Me-yow!
