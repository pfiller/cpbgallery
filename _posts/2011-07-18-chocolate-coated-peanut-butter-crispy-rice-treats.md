For whatever crazy reason, I don't think that peanut butter is the first flavor that comes to people's minds when they think of summer desserts. Hm, maybe I should campaign to fix that. Anyway... when it's a busy summer weekend and you have multiple events to run to, sometimes you've got to stick with something that's simple, reliable and delicious. Enter one of our faves: <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/dave-lieberman/crispy-rice-treats-recipe/index.html">Chocolate-Coated Peanut Butter Crispy Rice Treats</a>.

Despite the fact that I regularly spoil Taste Tester with fancy homemade desserts, some of his favorites are the simpler things. Instead of specially requesting some fancy multi-layer cake like he knows I'd make if he asked, he requested these easy-as-pie (but-not-pie) treats.

It's not just him though - everyone loves them. Crispy, coated with gooey delicious marshmallow and peanut butter and dipped in chocolate, what's not to love?

This was actually <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/02/17/chocolate-peanut-butter-cocoa-krispie-treats-2/">one of the very first recipes</a> I posted on this blog so many peanut butter jars ago and has remained a main-stay in our kitchen over the years. I've made it multiple times with varying degrees of success. If that surprises you then yes, let me say that even though it's a simple recipe, it is possible to have really good or just 'eh' crispy treats. 

Here's what I've learned:
&#8226; Grease your pan before making them. It's never a good feeling to stir your treats up in the pan, only to realize you have no where to put them.
&#8226; Stir fast, and turn the mixture over from the bottom up. This ensures great pb/marshmallow coverage without crushing the cereal.
&#8226; Grease your spatula in order to pat the treats down, without having the spatula stick. As an added bonus the little extra grease gives them a nice, glossy sheen.
&#8226; Pat them down enough so that they stick together, but not too firmly. The best crispy treats are light and airy and if you pat too hard, they will be dense and thick.
&#8226; If you don't have time to melt chocolate and dip them, a nice way to get your chocolate fix is to use Cocoa Krispies instead of Rice Krispies as I did in the <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/02/17/chocolate-peanut-butter-cocoa-krispie-treats-2/">original posting</a> of this recipe.
&#8226; If you do dip them, adding a drop of vegetable oil to the melted chocolate will prevent blooming.
