Ever since the first time I ordered this ice cream / topping combination at Cold Stone, I have yet to change my order. It's perfect. We finally decided to just buy the biggest size they sell and keep it stowed away in our freezer so as to eliminate the possibility of running out of it. *gasp!* The mere thought is saddening. Maybe we should go grab a backup gallon...

This is not an item on their menu, it's a combo you have to ask for. 
Here's what you order:

- chocolate ice cream
- marshmallows
- peanut butter (not cups or pieces, just straight peanut butter)
- chocolate fudge
- graham cracker pie crust

It is fantastically indulgent. You taste graham cracker bits, marshmallow, big globs of peanut butter... mmmm. Besides, you can always go to the gym <em>tomorrow</em>.

**Update**: I just found this combo on flickr by user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikespera/">erikespera</a>:

- chocolate ice cream
- peanut butter ice cream
- oreo cookie chunks
- butterfinger chunks
- chopped almonds
- served in a waffle bowl

Maybe I'll have to change my order sometime...
