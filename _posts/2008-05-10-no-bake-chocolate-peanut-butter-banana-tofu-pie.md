You are getting a double dose of delicious today! 

<a href="http://thebakingbird.blogspot.com/2008/05/finally-i-have-blog-ive-been-dreaming.html">Click here to obtain said deliciousness</a>. You're welcome!

Not only does this link provide you with a fantastic recipe for a beautiful <a href="http://thebakingbird.blogspot.com/2008/05/finally-i-have-blog-ive-been-dreaming.html">No Bake Peanut Butter Banana Tofu Pie</a>, but it also brings you to a brand spankin new food blog called <a href="http://thebakingbird.blogspot.com/">The Baking Bird</a>. This blog is especially great for all you vegans out there, tempting you with it's lovely photographs of glorious non-dairy creations. I certainly wouldn't miss dairy if I ate like Miss Kylie (the creator of this blog) does. Check out those photos!

Starting <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/">The Chocolate Peanut Butter Gallery</a> has not only provided me with an ever growing library of chocolate peanut butter recipes, but has also made me very aware of the food blogging world, and what a glorious one it is! There are so many nice, talented people out there writing about their tasty creations and doling out valuable kitchen wisdom. 

I'm happy to report that The Baking Bird is another great one to add to the list. The author says her blog will include, "food, food photography, photography, baking (especially vegan), cooking, nature, modern design, interior design, pumpkins and peanut butter (my two greatest obsessions--it's almost a little too obvious as you'll surely find out), and anything else inspiring and lovely." She had me convinced at "food" but seeing "peanut butter" on that list obviously piqued my interested. :P

For more fantastic food blogs to check out, take a look at my blogroll on the right of this page. And be sure to forward <a href="http://thebakingbird.blogspot.com/">The Baking Bird</a> out to your friends and friends of friends. It's new, it's great and people need to know it's there!

Don't forget to try her delicious AND healthful (!) <a href="http://thebakingbird.blogspot.com/2008/05/finally-i-have-blog-ive-been-dreaming.html">No Bake Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Tofu Pie</a>. Also, I don't let myself write whole posts on recipes unless they have both chocolate and peanut butter, but PLEASE take a look at these <a href="http://thebakingbird.blogspot.com/2008/05/coffee-mocha-vegan-cupcakes.html">Coffee Mocha Vegan Cupcakes</a>. Holy. Cow. Only, not cow because there's no milk. So... Holy. Soy.

And a quick thank you to all of you food bloggers out there that I've met through The CPBG. Thank you for entertaining me, sharing with me and teaching me. :) If you are reading this and you have a food blog, feel free to submit it and a sentence or two describing it in the comments section of this post. People should see your hard work!
