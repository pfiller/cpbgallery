Well, I'm sorry that I didn't discover this until the day of, but just incase you're <del datetime="2008-05-11T13:18:16+00:00">a bad person</del> a bit late on getting your mom a gift for Mother's Day, put in an order for these asap. Peanut Butter & Co is offering two <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/%5Citems_2.html">Mother's Day Gift Boxes</a> for you to choose from. In my opinion, as the stereotype says, all women love chocolate. So I suggest the brownies, but really they both look super tasty.

I have loved everything I've tried from <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter & Co</a>, so given their great track record, I'm bettin this gift idea is a winner!

I may be too late to order a gift and have it shipped on time, but it's not too late to send my regards. Happy Mother's Day to all you moms out there, and especially to mine. :)
