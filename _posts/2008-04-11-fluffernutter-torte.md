To cap off a week of culinary creativity at The CPB Gallery, check out this amazing cake. It was made by Heather Gilbert (also known as flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hjgilbert/">Alizarin8</a>) who is clearly a culinary genius. This is the anatomy (it contains 6 layers and 3 garnishes!) from bottom to top:



<blockquote>Pate sucre, salted peanut caramel, banana cake, choc/pb feuillitine, flamb&#233;d banana chiboust, homemade marshmellow fluff, garnished with carmelized banana, peanut brittle & milk chocolate placards.</blockquote>



I decided to do a bit of research because some of these words were unknown to my non-french-pastry-chef-trained brain. So here's a bit of education for you incase you are confused as well. These are the best definitions I could find:

<strong>Fancy Food Words Glossary</strong>
&#8226; <strong>Pate sucree</strong> = Tart shell. There is a basic recipe for it <a href="http://www.estarcion.com/gastronome/archives/001629.html">here</a>.
&#8226; <strong>Feuillitine</strong> = "A kind of french crepe that has been dried, looks like cornflakes but more fragrant." (quote from <a href="http://sakurambokitchen.blogspot.com/2007/11/chocolate.html">cherry's kitchen</a>)
&#8226; <strong>Chiboust</strong> = "A custard made originally as the filling for the g√¢teau Saint- Honor, consisting of pastry cream lightened with Italian meringue and stabilized with gelatine." (definition from <a href="http://www.cdkitchen.com/features/glossary/definition/Chiboust">cdkitchen</a>)

This cake sounds fantastic even without the big fancy words. I was looking at the description trying to pick out one particular part that sounded especially fantastic, but i'm convinced it's too difficult to choose. If one of the 800 parts of this cake doesn't inspire you in the kitchen, I don't know what will!

Heather's recipe is not posted with her photos, but I found this <a href="http://cookiebakerlynn.blogspot.com/2008/01/fluffernutter-cake.html">recipe for a Fluffernutter Cake with mini chocolate chips</a> over at <a href="http://cookiebakerlynn.blogspot.com/">Cookie Baker Lynn</a>. No fancy words, but it still sounds great. Or as she says, "perfect for banana lovers, peanut butter addicts, and Elvis fans alike!" Amen to that.
