A typical day at the grocery store... walking down the aisles... grabbed some cereal, grabbed some baking supplies... and then suddenly I see something new... chocolate tortilla chips?! Sweet! They're from the company <a href="http://www.foodshouldtastegood.com/">Food Should Taste Good</a>.

Instantly I thought a peanut butter bean dip would be a perfect match. And so the experiment began.

This dip is essentially a new twist on hummus. Peanut butter is used instead of tahini (sesame paste) and water is used to thin it out instead of olive oil. I decided not to use any spices so as not to muddle the lovely peanut butter flavor. It's a healthy salty peanut butter dip perfect for a chocolate utensil. While my taste tester loved the dip, he was not convinced by my store-bought chocolate tortilla chips. I have to admit, I wasn't totally convinced either. The salt hits you the second they touch your tongue (as is the case with any good tortilla chip) followed by a nice crunch and a sort of odd unsweetened cocoa flavor. They're just okay. 

The dip also tasted great on regular tortilla chips, but it's saltiness would go especially well with the contrasting sweetness of chocolate wafer cookies. If you're not in the mood for chocolate (does that ever happen?) and want a more savory snack, it would also go fantastically with carrots or celery.
