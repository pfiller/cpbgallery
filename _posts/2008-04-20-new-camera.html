Two things before I start blabbering about photography: first, the chocolate featured in these photos is <a href="https://www.askinosie.com/p-13-soconusco-75-85g3-oz.aspx">Askinosie</a> alongside Reeses Peanut Butter Chips. If you haven't tried Askinosie yet, you really should. It's definitely one of the better bars I've tried in a while. 

Second, I apologize for missing a day of posting yesterday. When I began this blog, I set out to post every day and have kept to that every day but two so far. I am only human though and it was just too gorgeous of a Saturday to spend time inside on the computer!

Now, some good news: I have some new fancy camera equipment to take pictures with for The Chocolate Peanut Butter Gallery. I've been working on my food photography over the last couple years so I'm happy to take the next step past your regular point and shoot digital camera. This is my equipment:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Rebel-XT-Camera/dp/B0007QKMSC/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1208634241&sr=8-8">Canon EOS 350D Digital Rebel XT</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006I53V">Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 Compact Macro Lens</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sigma-500-Super-Flash-Cameras/dp/B0002P19NK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1206280249&sr=8-4">Sigma EF 500 DG Super Flash</a> with awesome rotating head
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kstar810/2123569008/">Manfrotto 190XPROB Tripod</a> with awesome extendable arm

My regular digital camera is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD950IS-Stabilized-Titanium/dp/B000V1VG2O">Canon PowerShot SD950IS</a>. The Powershot is a great camera as well and I'm sure it will continue to be used out of convenience, especially when I'm out and about. 

The pictures for this post were taken with the new camera. I'll say for the record that they're not particularly great, but it's going to take me a while to get used to the new gadgets. I am excited to get to know them and hope that my photos will get better and better! I am also interested in buying a diffuser as using a flash is fairly vital to my photography since I don't really have any natural light in my kitchen.

This one came out a bit better, I think... it's a photo of Cadbury Mini-Eggs:

Feel free to impart any advice you have on food photography. :) I found <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/our-approach-to-food-photos/">this post</a> on Smitten Kitchen to be inspirational.
