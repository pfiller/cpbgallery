This cookbook is one of many that I've flipped through a bunch of times and stalked on the shelves in various book shops. Here's a sampling of the dialogue that goes on in my head:

"Sigh. There it is again." 

*flips through* 

"Ooooh!... Chocolate Caramel-Pecan Souffle!

"No. My shelf is way too full. I can't even jam books into the crannies anymore! I'm absolutely not buying you..."

*gasp* "HEAVEN-ON-A-STICK! What is that? I don't know but I want some!"

I've managed to walk away before, but this time I had a gift certificate to Williams Sonoma that I was looking to spend. Passing up the opportunity to finally have a <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/9561838/index.cfm">kitchen torch</a> (I'm a wuss, it's true), I picked up two cookbooks instead. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sticky-Chewy-Messy-Gooey-Desserts/dp/081185566X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229606514&sr=8-1">Sticky, Chewy, Messy, Gooey</a> made the cut.

So I just wanted to let you know incase you are having the same internal debate as I was (the case of Awesomely Tasty New Cookbook vs. Embarassingly Packed Shelf That Looks Like It's About To Quit It's Job), rest assured that it's worth it. Flipping through and reading the recipe descriptions is a mouthwatering experience. The pictures are incredible so I can only imagine how the contents within them must taste. I just picked it up the other day so haven't tried anything out of it yet, but will definitely be breaking it out when it comes time to make some holiday desserts. You know I'll fill you in when I do!

And to answer the ever burning question, it includes such CPB recipes as: 

&#8226; <strong>Crispy Oatmeal Florentines with Peanut Butter-Caramel Filling</strong> - Did I mention that florentines are one of my all-time favorite cookies? It's the Italian in me, I guess.

&#8226; <strong>White Trash Panini</strong> - As I sat flipping through this book, the page with this recipe caught Taste Tester's eye and he said that we absolutely had to make it. No argument here! The caption for this recipe is, "Lock the door, close the curtains, and turn over any copies of Gourmet magazine you may have in the house." Haha. Done and done. I love this book.

Buy it at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sticky-Chewy-Messy-Gooey-Desserts/dp/081185566X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229606514&sr=8-1">Amazon</a>!
