Generally speaking, I feel like a healthy person. Sure, my blog revolves mostly around dessert, but considering <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pnjtxfIJDE">the diva-like demands</a> of my sweet tooth, I do alright.

Or so I tend to think, until I hang out with actual healthy people and it occurs to me that I could stand to be healthier. Ack.

Recently, Taste Tester's cousin was in town visiting from Telluride, CO. As nice as it was to have him around, I was a little bit jealous of how much energy he has. As an active outdoorsy person and a healthy eater, he seemed to have double the energy I do, but he also likes and appreciates good eats. So when he recommended a new energy bar to me, I figured it might be a combination of the two (healthy and good) and decided to hunt it down. 

The variety of <a href="http://katesrealfood.com/">Kate's Real Food Bars</a> that I picked up (there are only 3 in the pic above, but I bought 5) were all pretty different and boasted a range of textures and flavors. Some were thicker and densely packed with nuts, seeds and hunks of dried fruits (yum!). Others were thinner and quite airy, with a texture similar to a rice krispie treat.

The <strong>Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate</strong> w/flax and hemp had an extra boost of texture and rich flavor from the seeds. The only other bar I can think of that looks similar to it in texture is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kstar810/2290430420/">ProBar</a>, but I remember those being overly-seedy and didn't particularly care for them.

I really liked the combo of dried apricots, bananas and raisins in the thicker bars like the <strong>PB&H Milk Chocolate</strong>. That one was on the edge of too sweet but it was still really good.

What's that? Close-up, you say? Why here you go:

The one bar that I was on the fence about was the <strong>Dark Chocolate Coconut Spice</strong>. The indian-inspired spices are *very* strong and definitely took me off guard. It was a little <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dCopAZaq8">whoa</a> at first but grew on me.

Overall though, the winner was the <strong>PB Dark Chocolate</strong> w/flax and hemp. I told it's wrapper so, but it just sat there. Oh, well.

The only thing that irked me about my tasty energy bar purchase was the "&H" that appeared on some of the flavor descriptions (like "PB&H Dark Chocolate"). Does anyone know what that might mean? I am lucky not to suffer any food allergies but as someone who is conscious of ingredients for loved ones who are, I didn't like how unclear this abbreviation was. And even after looking on the back of the bar and their site for a bit, I'm still not sure. "& Honey"? "& Hemp?" "& Happiness?" WHAT DOES IT MEAN?! (It looks like they might have maybe ditched this on their new packaging, but the curiosity remains).

I'll counter that with a good point though: while doing research on the "&H", I found that their site recommends that you can freeze the bars if you buy a large stash. I never would have considered freezing an energy bar and now I'm curious how well it stands up. Interesting point, <a href="http://katesrealfood.com/">website</a>! 

(Note to self: stop talking at inanimate objects - they can't hear you. Isn't that right, desk?)

Now before you call me a total health dummy, I am aware that eating healthy snack bars will not give me a permanent energy boost and instant six pack. So last week I got back on the horse and started working out again, for the first time since early September. I'm admittedly much lazier in the colder months, since I don't have to wear a bathing suit and no one can see the evidence of my laziness through my winter coat. But another healthy friend (hi, John!) reminded me that you do feel a lot better when you work out. And he's right.

If you're in the mood for a tasty and healthy snack that can fit in your pocket but still fill you up, pick up some of <a href="http://katesrealfood.com/">Kate's Real Food Bars</a>. And if you've fallen off, get back on the horse with me.
