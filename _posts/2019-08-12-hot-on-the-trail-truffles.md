“See you on the trail™”

I think these truffles are flirting with me. 

“Not if I see you first!”

[Crickets]

Oops- misread that. Anyway, we love these truffles. In fact, I love them so much that I’m resurrecting my 11 year old blog to write about them*. Hm, what’s changed since my last blog post?

- We visited all 50 states.
- We moved to Austin, but Austin was too hot for my purse chocolate, so we came back to NYC.
- I’m still 5’ 1.75” so no change there. I think. *runs off and grabs ruler*
- People express emotions using blinky things called gifs. Or giphys. Or giphs. I dunno - they’ve    literally been arguing about it for the entire decade that I’ve been on blog hiatus.

One big thing that changed is that Taste Tester works out now. He lived in NJ for seven years, but has just gotten the state’s coined “GTL” thing. Just kidding - he doesn’t do the laundry! Lols.

Anyway, with this unexpected turn of events, I’ve been on a search to find new snacks that he likes that are all of the following things. He wants to get the most from his workouts and we want to flagrantly show off how annoying we are:

- Nut-free
- Packed with protein
- Vegetarian / vegan
- No refined sugar
- Gluten-free
- Tasty

Enter [Trail Truffles](https://www.trailtruffles.com)! Unfortunately I have yet to eat them on an actual trail, unless you count the path from the office kitchen to my desk a trail. I installed hike markers, but I’m still waiting on the State Park recognition. 

I’ve only had the [Peanut Butter Cup Trail Truffles](https://www.trailtruffles.com/collections/peanut-butter-cup), but I’ve just visited their website to write this award-winning blog post and gasp! They have other flavors! They also come in Chocolate Hazelnut, Mint Creme, and Coconut Macadamia. Their website shares that they base their design on traditional French chocolate truffles with a creamy filling. They taste it, too. They’re amazing and you’ll be transported into a scene of Chocolat when you eat them. Except that during my blog hiatus, there’s been an added scene in the movie where Johnny Depp’s character marries a PYT and they have a violent, terrible marriage. Like I said, a lot has changed in the last ten years and they’re really getting out-of-hand with the movie re-makes now.

Trail Truffles’ mission states _“Consumers are often forced to choose among rugged, healthful, or decadent food for the Trail. Our mission was to develop a source of fuel that delivers all three—resulting in the perfect, high-protein energy bite for whatever Trail you're blazing.”_

It goes on to say, _“We knew there were some dietarily challenged people out there who are typically nice but lose their fucking minds and go a special form of apeshit if they get a little hangry. And so we made this just for them and for the society we’d be protecting from them.”_

Took a weirdly specific turn there, but accurate! Thank you for making these - they’re so rich and filling and we can’t stop buying them. Pick yourself up a bag in stores or on their website. 

*_I also resurrected this to make a post for Taste-Tester because today is his birthday and I love him very much. He makes all of my dreams come true on all the crazy trails we’ve taken, even when they include writing ridiculous blogs about beans._
