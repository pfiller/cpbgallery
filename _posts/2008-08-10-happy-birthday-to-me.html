Yay! Today is that one day that seems to take forever to roll around. It's the day that I get to eat my very own slice of birthday cake! What? Presents too? Nah I don't need those, just give me some cake and a fork. Actually forget the fork, I don't need it. I have hands... and no shame. 

That said, who is going to bake <a href="http://bakerella.blogspot.com/2008/06/got-milk-i-hope-so.html">this chocolate peanut butter cake</a> for me? Anyone? Come on, don't make me beg on my birthday...
