I don't like to let icing go to waste. The other day when I made Susan Spicer's <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/06/04/banana-chocolate-chip-cupcakes-with-peanut-butter-cream-cheese-icing/">Banana Chocolate Chip Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Frosting</a>, I had a little bit of leftover frosting. Oh, what is a girl to do?

What's that you say? Check to make sure no one's watching and lick the bowl clean? Well... that would be nice, but I might end up feeling a tad sick, so onto plan B.

There were some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NABISCO-FAMOUS-CHOC-WAFERS-CT/dp/B0002QF1NS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=gourmet-food&qid=1212630899&sr=1-1">Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers</a> in my pantry. These are a great pantry item, by the way. You can crush them up to make a chocolate cookie pie crust (for <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/double-chocolate-peanut-butter-pie">Double Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie</a>), use them as decoration on a cake, crumble them into a bowl of ice cream or just eat them out of the box. On this particular night however, I simply used the rest of my icing as the filling in some quickly assembled sandwich cookies. A great easy snack. And they actually get better with a little time - the cookies soften a bit giving them more of a homemade instead of store-bought flavor.
