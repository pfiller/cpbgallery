The only thing better than laying eyes on this giant peanut butter egg Easter morning would be seeing a peanut butter hen large enough to hatch it!

This egg is a whopping 6 ounces of chocolate-covered peanut butter and measures in around 4 inches long (the photo above is just about actual size). Differing slightly from it's more petite cousin <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2010/02/26/reeses-milk-chocolate-peanut-butter-eggs/#comments">the little egg</a>, the big egg's milk chocolate layer is a substantial 1/4 inch thick as opposed to the small egg's very thin chocolate coating. 

So which one is better? Taste Tester seems to prefer the chocolate to peanut butter ratio of the smaller egg, but I like the larger because I love me some extra chocolate. Also, it might just be because we got a really fresh egg, but I thought the peanut butter filling in the larger egg was creamier. Despite their differences, they're both good eggs!

By the way, I really love how many of you wrote in to say that you too thought that the <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2010/02/26/reeses-milk-chocolate-peanut-butter-eggs/#comments">Reese's Peanut Butter Egg was better than the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup</a>. Thanks for making me feel a little less crazy. Will you be giving the larger version a try? If not, you know what I'll be saying...

*bock, bock, bock BOCK!*
