I'm going to do something a little unconventional here, maybe even a little frightening. I'm promoting a healthy recipe on The Chocolate Peanut Butter Gallery. The concept is scary for me too, but we can get through this together. And really once you get to reading the recipe you will likely find yourself hungry, not skeptical. 

I thought it would be fair to plug my other favorite magazine, after <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/30/everyday-foods-chocolate-peanut-butter-pie/">spotlighting</a> <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/everyday">Everyday Food</a> yesterday. <a href="http://www.cookinglight.com/cooking/">Cooking Light</a> was my first magazine subscription of any kind, let alone of food. I thought I might get bored of it, and thought that "light" recipes had the potential to be a little scary, but three years later I still get a bit giddy when an issue shows up in my mail box.

Cooking Light reuses some tricks to lighten recipes, some of which are present in this one. It uses fluffed up egg-whites which are healthier than using the whole egg and add air and volume to the batter. They also use some reduced-fat peanut butter and fat-free milk. But what I like about them is that not all of their ingredients are scary healthy. They still have some good old fashioned sugar in there as well as unsweetened chocolate and cocoa powder. The mag also provides you with some nutritional facts so you can enjoy one of these cookies knowing that you've only taken in 70 calories instead of 300, or whatever the norm is for an indulgent snack. 

(Small tangent: I also noticed that Starbucks started posting the calories in their sweets right on their individual nametags. While I'm not sure if it's good for their business since it encouraged me to pass up a 450 calorie <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutrition_food_detail.asp?selProducts=%7B178615AA%2D63AA%2D46E9%2D919F%2D454308F6E888%7D&store=7238&foodZone=16">Pecan Magic Bar</a>, I appreciated it, nonetheless.)

These peanut butter chocolate meringues don't sound like one of their fastest recipes, but they certainly sound good. They have a few of my favorite qualities in a dessert. Quality #1: They are meringues. I know there are some people out there who may not have tried meringues, but you should. They are a pretty satisfying snack while being low in calories. Trader Joes carries a nice variety of them, if you're curious. Quality #2: They have chocolate. Quality #3: They have peanut butter. If you came to this website and couldn't figure out what #2 & 3 were going to be, you are hereby fired as a reader of this blog.

Oh, who am I kidding... I could never fire you! Enjoy this recipe from <a href="http://find.myrecipes.com/recipes/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&recipe_id=630149#anga.com/">Cooking Light</a>. Recipe after the break.
