Did they say 'groovy' in the 60's? I'm not used to having to google for historical accuracy whilst writing about chocolate and peanut butter.

Though I love writing about CPB, every once in a while it becomes hard to stifle discussion of my other loves: art and design. That said, I really enjoy it when the two converge.

I was recently browsing flickr for some photos of my alma mater, <a href="http://www.pratt.edu/">Pratt Institute</a> when I discovered this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34900073@N07/with/3370974890/">awesome archive of old photos</a> posted by the <a href="http://library.pratt.edu/">Pratt Libraries</a>. There's everything in it from photos of the Brooklyn campus in the late 1800's to student work across decades. In it, I discovered this fun shot of package design for Skippy Peanut Butter.

I'm not sure if it's as interesting to you if you're only here to eat peanut butter as opposed to gawk at it, but I thought it was pretty cool. For me, half of the fun of perusing adorable bakeries and quaint little groceries is to "eat with my eyes" and take in the beautiful design as well as the yumminess that awaits inside the pretty packages. If only I could travel back and peruse a gourmet store in the 60s. Maybe some day, when time machines finally do exist. Any day now, scientists. Any day now.

For more fun vintage products, check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christianmontone/3962439382/in/set-72157621974452165/">this photostream</a>, which has 1960's jars by Peter Pan, Jif, Planter's, Welch's and another by Skippy.

If you click, you'll notice that the jar of Skippy was marked for a slim $0.25. Lucky hippies.
