There has been an intense on-going debate for who makes the best cupcake in NYC. There are the Magnolia lovers and the Magnolia haters. There are lists upon lists and arguments upon arguments. Well, I'm here to settle the debate for you.

<strong>The best cupcake is NOT in NYC.</strong>

It's in Florida. At a chain called <a href="http://www.mishascupcakes.com/">Misha's Cupcakes</a>.

This is the second time I've had these cupcakes. The first time they were shipped to me by my friend Carla. Yes - shipped. How did the cupcakes look after the shipping?

Not so great. These came to me five days after they were baked because we kept missing the UPS guy and we were pretty skeptical of how they'd taste being old and well... mashed. But my friend went through the trouble of buying and shipping them so of course we had to taste. How did the cupcakes taste after the shipping?

UNBELIEVABLE! How could it be possible that the best store-bought cupcake I had ever had sat in a box for a few days and came from Florida, not NYC? Florida isn't even on my cupcake radar, while NYC / Magnolia is all I hear about when it comes to cupcakes! This experience truly turned my cupcake world upside down.

The top pic is the marble cake with vanilla frosting, the second is vanilla cake with vanilla frosting, and the third is a little Red Velvet that has chocolate chips, topped with vanilla frosting. Mmmm... 

They are by far the moistest and most flavorful cupcakes I've ever gotten from a bakery. Carla is determined to figure out the secret. She went through at least a few batches of cupcakes already, changing up the recipe to see if she could match Misha's. They are that good - totally worth the effort. The chocolate and vanilla are great but the Marble is probably my favorite. Mischa says on her website that she started baking cupcakes using her mom's chocolate cake recipe, and used it to formulate her own vanilla recipe.

And the icing?! Also delicious. The vanilla is great, but I also love the coconut. 

If you're skeptical of me if I'm hating on your favorite cupcakery, I've had some of the "best" cupcakes in NYC: <a href="http://www.magnoliacupcakes.com/">Magnolia</a>, <a href="http://www.sugarsweetsunshine.com/">Sugar Sweet Sunshine</a>, <a href="http://www.billysbakerynyc.com/">Billy's</a>, <a href="http://www.crumbsbakeshop.com/">Crumbs</a>, <a href="http://www.babycakesnyc.com/">Babycakes</a>, etc. All good (well I was pretty eh about Babycakes) but none hold a candle to Misha's. I'll just hold on to hope that they open a store up here so I don't have to bug someone to bring em back on a plane for me, or do it myself. 

And incase you're wondering where the chocolate and peanut butter is in this post, Misha's sells both chocolate and peanut butter cupcakes, which makes it a great place to get your CPB fix! Sadly I haven't gotten my hands on the peanut butter yet, but it's definitely a motivating factor for taking a trip to Florida. :D I'll have to keep you posted on whether or not the peanut butter lives up to the deliciousness of it's peers.
