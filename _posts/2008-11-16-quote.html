This quote is from <a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/restaurants-bars/68428/top-chefs-in-new-york-reveal-kitchen-secrets">Time Out New York's "Chef Secrets SPILLED!"</a> feature, which included some incite into the minds of NYC's chefs.

In defense of foodies, bloggers, and food lovers, I'd just like to point out that while we may not be professional food critics, we are the customers and the people that consume, <em>pay for</em> and spread the word of your food, so it might be wise to listen to what we have to say.

In my experience so far with people in the food industry, they don't seem to think like this for the most part, but I think those that do should open their minds and ears a bit.

On the whole, I enjoyed this article and think it's interesting to hear the chefs' opinions. I recently finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1226886018&sr=8-1">Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential</a>, which I highly recommend if you haven't already read it. As someone who has definitely toyed with the idea of dropping everything and taking up cooking classes, it gave me a whole new perspective and gave me an idea of what that would be like.
