I'm off to spend two whole weeks in Spain, with side trips to Portugal and Morocco. Yay! Looking forward to some adventures, both culinary and otherwise. Although I'm a little concerned for peanut butter availability over there... I've gotten quite a few sad messages from fellow CPB lovers abroad who can't get their hands on the good stuff. That's so sad! Maybe I'll have to bring some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kstar810/4932793013/">to-go packs</a> along for the ride?

Here's holding onto hope that I find some CPB overseas. In the meantime, here are some links to keep you busy while I'm gone. Enjoy! I'll miss you!
