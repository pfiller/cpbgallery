Don't get the title? Check out <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2010/09/17/awkward-monkey-donuts/">my previous post</a>.

I was flipping through a recent issue of Everyday with Rachael Ray and came across <a href="http://www.rachaelraymag.com/Recipes/rachael-ray-magazine-recipe-index/breakfast-brunch-recipes/Banana-Doughnuts-with-Banana-Frosting">a recipe for Banana Doughnuts</a>. With a pile of ripe bananas in my kitchen and that <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2010/09/17/awkward-monkey-donuts/">Monkey-See Monkey-Donut</a> still fresh in my mind, I knew what I had to do. 

Doughnuts are one of the seemingly few types of desserts that I've never made before, so this seemed like a great recipe to make to cross them off the list. I don't own a doughnut pan so I baked these in my twinkie pan - which you may remember from <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/04/02/devils-food-twinkies-with-peanut-butter-filling/">Devil's Food Twinkies with Peanut Butter Filling</a>. Oh, why did I have to click that link- now I want a twinkie! *Sigh* I live a tough life.

These turned out to be kind of a mix between a doughnut and a muffin. I remember thinking the same thing about <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2010/05/03/doughnuts-donuts-doh-nuts/">Doughnut Plant's Banana Doughnut</a> as well though so maybe that's just how it goes? This wasn't an issue for me though, since they were very good. My only real qualm with the recipe is that the banana frosting didn't set into a hard coating like most doughnut frostings do. It was great and they tasted wonderful- that just wasn't what I was expecting. Maybe adding a little extra powdered sugar would have done the trick? I was also planning on sharing them with a friend, but with the messy icing, couldn't really pack them up and transport them without expecting a hot mess later on. So no doughnuts for my friend. Sadness.

The banana frosting sounded good and all, but wanting to mix it up (and be a little extra naughty... hee!), I decided to fill some of the doughnuts with marshmallow fluff and others with chocolate peanut butter ganache. Feeling too lazy to pipe the filling, I just cut a slit down the middles of them and added the filling using a pastry spreader. I covered the slit with the banana frosting and topped it all off with chocolate sprinkles (aka jimmies) so that they looked even more like doughnuts. They were so cute! And check out that filling.

Whoa mama.

<strong>Here are some different ideas for customizing these bad boys:</strong>
- Make them as is (banana doughnut topped with banana frosting)
- Fill with marshmallow fluff and top with banana frosting & chocolate sprinkles
- Fill with chocolate peanut butter ganache (recipe below) and top with banana frosting & chocolate sprinkles
- Fill with marshmallow fluff and top with chocolate peanut butter ganache
- Don't frost them with anything and eat them warm. Maybe dip them into your morning coffee or chocolate peanut butter hot chocolate. Mmm!

<strong>Note:</strong> If you opt to fill them with marshmallow fluff, fill and let them sit for 10 minutes so the fluff can settle. If you don't, your frosting will sink in the middle once it settles. Also, sometimes the fluff evaporates a little after a couple days so I'd recommend eating them within a day or two. I think you're up to the task!

Recipe after the break. Enjoy!

<strong>Chocolate Peanut Butter Ganache</strong>
<em>modified from <a href="http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/785188/jewish/Doughnut-Glazes.htm">this recipe</a></em>

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 1/2 Tbsp smooth peanut butter
6 oz chocolate, chopped and melted (I used a mix of milk and semi-sweet)
1 1/2 tsp light corn syrup
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

<strong>Directions</strong>
Bring the heavy cream to a simmer with the peanut butter, stirring until homogenous but not over-heated. Stir this into the melted chocolate. Then add the corn syrup and vanilla and whisk to combine. Store any leftover glaze in the refrigerator for up to 1 week and, once very chilled, make truffles! Just scoop it into large acorn-size pieces and, after rolling them into balls, roll them in the powdered sugar toppings, as listed (either the one flavored with cinnamon or cocoa). Store the truffles in the refrigerator.
