I don't get to bake with nuts too often these days (peanuts are not a nut- they're a legume!) because my boyfriend / primary taste tester can't eat them. 

But he's out of town. Hehe...

I'm not sure if I have a favorite nut or not. I probably eat pecans the most. I put them in my cereal, salads, pastas and baked goods. But I love macadamias and especially so in brownies and blondies. This recipe is adapted from <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/0618443363/103-8370542-8519815">Baking: From My Home To Yours</a> by Dorie Greenspan. The brown sugar / caramel flavor of this blondie lends itself really well to the white chocolate / butterscotch combination. 

The peanut butter in this recipe is more of a background flavor, but definitely adds to the overall awesomeness of these. If that's not enough for you though, you could do 2 oz white choc chips, 2 oz bittersweet chips & 2 oz peanut butter chips instead, to sneak some more pb in there.

<strong>White Chocolate Butterscotch Blondies</strong><br>
makes 16 bars<br>
<br>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
1 cup all purpose flour<br>
1/2 tsp baking powder<br>
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon<br>
1/4 tsp baking soda<br>
1/4 tsp salt<br>
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter<br>
5 Tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature<br>
3/4 cup granulated sugar<br>
3/4 cup dark brown sugar<br>
2 large eggs<br>
1/2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
3/4 cup chopped salted macadamia nuts<br>
4 oz white chocolate chips<br>
4 oz butterscotch chips<br>
<br>
<strong>Directions</strong><br>
1. Preheat oven to 350&#176;. Line a 9 inch square baking pan with parchment paper and grease with butter.<br>
2. Whisk the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.<br>
3. In another bowl, beat the butter and peanut butter on medium speed until smooth. Add both the sugars and beat for 1 to 2 minutes, until well incorporated into the butters. Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 1 minute after each addition. Add the vanilla extract. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients, until just combined. Add the nuts and chips.<br>
4. Bake the blondies for 35 to 40 minutes, or until they turn a deep honey brown and a toothpick comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a rack and cool to room temperature.<br>
5. When it is completely cool, carefully lift the blondies out of the pan and cut into 16 bars.
