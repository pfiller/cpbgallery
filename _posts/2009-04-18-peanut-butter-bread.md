After finding <a href="http://dinnersforayear.blogspot.com/2009/03/peanut-butter-bread.html">this post</a> on Tastespotting, I knew that I couldn't go on without knowing what on earth Peanut Butter Bread tasted like. I had to make some! One of my cookbooks - the <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/0312334176">Tate's Bake Shop Cookbook</a> - happened to have a recipe for it.

I can now rest assured with the newfound knowledge that Peanut Butter bread is yummy! It had a nice density and wasn't too sweet, which made it perfect for both breakfast and dessert. The texture was a little more crumbly than I would have liked, as it fell apart easily and was a little messy to eat. The crust, however was perfect; the slight caramelization added great flavor to the loaf.

I expected the peanut butter flavor to be really strong since there was a whole cup of peanut butter in this loaf. It was definitely present, but not overwhelming. I'd definitely make this again but might try adding even more peanut butter and maybe more egg so that it will hold together better. Do you think that would work? I'm always a little hesitant when it comes to messing with bread recipes, even if this is a quick bread.

It's tasty on it's own, but you can also make a little sandwich filled with fluff and chocolate chips and let it sit so that the bread can absorb the marshmallow a little. Mmmm. For breakfast, it was perfect when heated slightly and topped with butter.

If you're not up for changing the recipe as I've mentioned above, this was tasty as is and you should absolutely try it if you've never had peanut butter bread before. The curiosity was too much for me to handle!
