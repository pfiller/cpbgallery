<a href="http://www.wilton.com/recipes/recipesandprojects/backtoschool/pb&jcake.cfm">This PB&J Cake</a> from Wilton's website is not only made in the shape of a "<a href="http://www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?sku=2105-4943&killnav=1">huggable teddy bear</a>" but also contains peanut butter, jelly and chocolate chips. You of course don't need to make yours in the shape of a teddy, but you would be doing so at the risk of going down a few notches in adorability. (And yes, <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adorability">adorability</a> is a word. Take that!)

Check out the recipe <a href="http://www.wilton.com/recipes/recipesandprojects/backtoschool/pb&jcake.cfm">here</a>.

If you browsed the ingredients like I did you might also be thinking "what the hell is almond brickle?" Comfortingly, a google search proves that I'm not the only confused one. It looks like people tend to interpret this into being anything from <a href="http://www.cyber-kitchen.com/ubbs/archive/CANDY/Brickle_Butter_Brickle.html">this homemade variety</a> to something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hersheys-Heath-Bits-Brickle-Toffee/dp/B000AP6SGU">Hershey's Heath Bits O' Brickle</a>. It seems that either type would amount to a tasty end result.

I've been pretty curious about mixing the pb&j combo with the c&pb combo. Though this recipe has yet to materialize in my kitchen, it seems like a safe bet.
