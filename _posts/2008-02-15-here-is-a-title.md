What to do when one has leftover pate brisee dough from making an apple pie? I did what any sensible person would do after they had already been baking all day and baked some more. It was a good decision. Instructions after the break.

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
1 recipe pate brisee (see below)
8 T natural chunky peanut butter
8 T chocolate chips
24 slices of banana (2-3 bananas, depending on how thick you want your slices)
generous sprinkle of cinnamon (per empanada)
pinch of salt (per empanada)

<strong>Coating</strong>
2 egg yolks
2 T heavy cream
turbinado sugar

Preheat your oven to 375 and cover baking sheets with parchment paper. 

First, roll out half your dough to a 14 inch square that is 1/8 inch thick on a floured work surface. Cut into approx 4 - 7x7 inch squares. Spread 1 T of peanut butter in the center of each square, leaving a 1 inch border all around. (As you can see mine are not exactly squares... they don't have to be perfect to be delicious)

Second, sprinkle 1 T chocolate chips on top of your peanut butter layer. I used Ghiradelli semisweet because that's what was hanging out in my cabinet.

Next, add three banana slices per square, and dust with a generous sprinkle of cinnamon and a small pinch of salt.

Then, fold the squares in half as neat as you can, smushing the contents inside so they fit. They may appreciate like the abuse, but they'll still taste super. Then use a fork to make sure the edges of your empanada are sealed (and pretty!). 

Relocate your sealed empanadas to prepared baking sheets. Cut slits into the tops of them so that steam can escape during baking. Combine the egg yolks and heavy cream in a small bowl. Using a brush, brush the coating onto each empanada and dust with turbinado sugar.

Bake in a preheated oven for 20-22 minutes or until golden brown and juices inside are bubbling through the slices you made in the tops of the empanadas. You should wait just a second so they aren't burn-your-tongue-hot, but they are super delicious warm.

This recipe yields 8 empanadas. They can be made 2 days in advance and refrigerated. Just take them out when you preheat the oven and bake at your convenience. This is especially helpful when you want to stumble out of bed to a gourmet breakfast without having to do much work.

<strong>Pate Bris&#233;e</strong> (from Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook)
Makes enough for 8 empanadas, one double-crust or two single-crust 9-inch pies

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
For the flakiest crust, make sure all ingredients are cold before you begin.
2-1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, cold, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup ice water, plus more if needed

<strong>Directions</strong>
In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and salt; pulse to combine. Add the butter, and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crmbs with some larger pieces remaining, about 10 seconds. (To mix by hand, combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl, then cut in butter with a pastry blender.)

With the machine running, add the ice water through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream, just until the dough holds together without being wet or sticky. Do not process more than 30 seconds. Test by squeezing a small amount of the dough together; if it is still too crumbly, add a bit more water 1 tablespoon at a time.

Turn out the dough onto a clean work surface. Divide in half, and place each half on a piece of plastic wrap. Shape into flattened disks. Wrap in plastic, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. The dough can be frozen for up to 1 month; thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.

I made these in advance then waited to coat and bake them 2 days later for breakfast. Bake for 20- 22 minutes in a 375 oven.
