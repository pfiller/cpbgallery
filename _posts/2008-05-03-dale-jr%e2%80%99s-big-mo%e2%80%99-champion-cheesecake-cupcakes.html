This bar has been sitting in my chocolate peanut butter stash for a couple of weeks now waiting it's turn to be tasted / reviewed. Finding a recipe that calls for the bar on the web reminded me about it, and so I finally took a bite.

We are used to seeing celebrity faces grace the wrappers and boxes of many products in the grocery store. But this bar actually has the celebrity's name in the title, which at least to my knowledge is unusual. I found a press release for the bar <a href="http://www.jrmotorsport.com/tracknews/press/09_18_07.html">here</a> (warning if your computer sound is high, the sound on the site is obnoxious!). I read a bit about it, but quite honestly racing is not my thing, so I'll leave the reading to you, if you're interested. I'm more curious about the bar itself, which comes in both peanut butter and caramel.

<a href="http://www.bigmo-ment.com/eng-us/default.aspx">Dale's bar</a> is by <a href="http://www.rmpalmer.com/default.asp">R.M.Palmer</a>, who's chocolate I haven't been much a fan of in the past. I always feel kinda bad giving mediocre reviews for products, but this just didn't really do it for me. After I opened it, it was clear that it was going to be one of those, "this is sitting on my desk, so I'm going to keep eating it," snacks. I've been eating a lot of higher quality dark chocolate lately and it continually amazes me that the general American public prefers lower quality milk chocolate like this bar over the other, better stuff that's out there. If you are a classic milk chocolate kind of consumer, this might be a good bar for you. Unfortunately, it's not for me.

I will say that I enjoyed the shape of it. It's segments are thin and rectangular as opposed to the cup shaped peanut butter filled chocolates we're used to eating. It melts in your mouth nicely and the shape was a nice change of pace from the norm.

Also. I'm sure I'd enjoy it much more if it were hidden inside a cheesecake cupcake! Enjoy this recipe for Dale Jr's Big Mo' Champion Cheesecake Cupcakes from the <a href="http://www.chocolateatlas.com/Chocolate_Recipes/S081_Champion_Cheesecake_Cupcakes.htm">Chocolate Atlas</a>.
