Hi and sorry for the long delay! Taste Tester and I have been busy travelling to the Chicago area for a week+ where we will be spending time with family. We will also of course be hunting down chocolate peanut butter treats (like the awesome <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/07/30/back-with-a-bang-a-review-of-mollys-cupcakes/">Ron Bennington Cupcake</a> from <a href="http://www.mollyscupcakes.com/">Molly's</a> - yuuUUUuum!) 

Before we left, I whipped up a batch of these excellent <a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/recipe.aspx?recipeID=46683&Source=SearchResultPage&terms=peanut%20butter">Chocolate Peanut Butter Treats Cookies</a> whose taste is reminiscent of <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/07/06/chocolate-peanut-butter-puppy-chow/">Puppy Chow</a> (click the link if you don't know what I'm talking about - they don't taste like Purina, I promise). These are peanut butter cookies coated in a chocolate peanut butter mixture and then coated in powdered sugar. I have yet to meet someone that dislikes Puppy Chow, so it stands to reason that everyone will love these cookies!

Unfortunately, despite the fact that they're partially made from a store-bought mix, they still take a good amount of time to make. The coating, at least for me, didn't go on as quickly and easily as it does when making Puppy Chow. The process is easy, it just takes a little time and patience. It's possible that my chocolate mixture should have been melted just a tad longer, so I won't fault the recipe until I try it again. Just be aware when microwaving the chocolate mixture that you want it smooth for easy-coating, but not over-heated it because then the chocolate can get cakey and you'll just have to chuck the whole thing. 

Fun fact: I came up with the <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/05/12/a-rod-wins-at-brooklyn-kitchens-3rd-annual-cupcake-cookoff/">A-Rod Cupcake</a> as a result of having extra peanut butter cookies from this recipe sitting around my kitchen. So if you made or tasted the A-Rod, you can thank this recipe!
