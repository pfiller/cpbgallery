There are other chocolate holidays besides Valentine's Day?? Say what?!

There are actually many sweet holidays during the year (see full list after the break) that celebrate chocolate and peanut butter! But are these "holidays" made up? It seems that way considering there's even the oddly specific "Bittersweet Chocolate with Almond" Day. However, according to the people at <a href="http://www.candyusa.org/Classroom/calendar.asp">The National Confectioner's Association</a> they are perfectly valid holidays and that's sure good enough for me. Read how these days are determined on <a href="http://www.candyusa.org/Classroom/special_days.asp">their website</a>.

There is no doubt that there are a lot of fantastic days to celebrate- a total of 20 to be exact! But there is one clear day missing. National Chocolate and Peanut Butter Day! What's up with that? But really, one day a year is not enough for the fantastic c&pb combo anyhow. Every day is Chocolate and Peanut Butter Day!... at least at this blog. 

Peanut butter & peanuts look to get a lot less celebratory days than chocolate, but they do get the entire months of March & November to be honored, so we can't complain too much. Chocolate lovers can enjoy the month of February at the <a href="http://www.hot-chocolate-festival.com/">City Bakery</a> in NYC where they celebrate every day of the month with a fancy flavor of hot chocolate. This includes such craziness as Beer Hot Chocolate, and something awesome sounding called Sunken Treasure Hot Chocolate. Yum!
