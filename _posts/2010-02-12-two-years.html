Wow, it's been two whole years of chocolate and peanut butter blogging! I wonder how much chocolate and peanut butter I've actually consumed. Then again, maybe I don't want to know!

This blog has helped me learn a great deal about my two favorite ingredients, including new and creative ways to put them to use. It has also seen me meet a few goals including <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/03/03/not-your-mamas-oatmeal/">writing some of my own recipes</a> and designing <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/02/23/askinosie-chocolate-design/">chocolate packaging</a>. I even <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/10/26/a-chocolatey-proposal/">got engaged at a chocolate factory</a>! 

I can honestly say that when I started this blog, I wasn't sure how long I could keep it up for. But two years in, it feels like I could do it for a long, long time. Maybe in the future the blog will lead me to meet other goals. Perhaps I'll visit a peanut butter factory. Maybe I'll write more recipes and eventually a cookbook! Who knows? But I hope that you stick around to find out with me!

Below are some of my favorite reader comments. Thanks for being a part of this with me!
