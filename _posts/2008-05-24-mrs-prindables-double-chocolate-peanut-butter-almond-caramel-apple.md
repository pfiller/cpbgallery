Apples are healthy... right?

This one might not be since it's coated in dark and milk chocolate, peanut butter, caramel and almonds. It's 1.5 pounds and serves 8-10 people. They have a link on their site that displays the actual size of this freakishly large apple. But if you're not in the mood to share, they also sell a petite apple that won't force you to go out and buy pants in a larger size.

If sending one as a gift, you can send a <a href="http://www.mrsprindables.com/store/index.asp?rectype=gourmet&department_id=35">special occasion apple</a> or dress it up with one of their cute ornaments including flowers, graduation hats or ties for Father's Day.

Indulge in the latest "health food" craze and buy one at <a href="http://www.mrsprindables.com/store/item.asp?item_id=102&department_id=34s=cse_nextag">Mrs. Prindables</a>.
