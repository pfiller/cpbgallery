The ever-formidable sweet craving hit me after dinner tonight, as it always does. Oh, what is a girl to do? Luckily, I was within a 15 minute walk of <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter & Co</a> so naturally it was the chosen destination. 

I have a habit of perusing the shelves before ordering something at Peanut Butter & Co., just by chance that they might have released a new product since my last visit. I was delighted to discover two brand new flavors of pb: <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/detail_17010008__4.html">Mighty Maple</a> and <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/detail_17010007__4.html">The Bee's Knees</a>! Though The Bee's Knees had a more fun name, maple flavored peanut butter was a bit more intriguing to me. Unable to decide, a friendly employee offered me a sample spoonful of each. As you can conclude from the photos, I walked out with both jars in hand.

The peanut butters look relatively similar in color, with the Mighty Maple being a barely noticeable darker shade of brown (the maple is on the left in this photo). I tasted The Bee's Knees first and was surprised to be able to taste such a strong honey flavor, when it seems that peanuts could easily mask honey. The maple was superb - I enjoyed it so much that it made me wonder why no one thought to combine these compatible flavors before (at least to my knowledge). Both peanut butters have very distinct flavors, and though I just purchased them tonight and have yet to fully experiment with snack ideas, I can say with complete confidence that they taste fantastic on a spoon.

Below is a quick snack I assembled. It is a honey graham cracker, with a healthy layer of The Bee's Knees Peanut Butter topped with Butterfinger Marble Mix-Ins.

Originally I couldn't decide between chocolate chips or cocoa nibs as a topping for the peanut butter, but eventually scrapped both and went with the Butterfinger Marble Mix Ins. They aren't super chocolately, but have a strong enough flavor to be interesting. They add an extra chocolate peanut butter kick without being overwhelming, so they didn't hide the lovely honey flavor this peanut butter has to offer.

With chocolate crunchies and chopped up butterfinger chocolate bar, Butterfinger Marble Mix-Ins are a great addition to your kitchen. They can also be used on yogurt or sprinkled over a bowl of Reeses Puffs for breakfast. Between those and two new fantastic flavors of peanut butter, your pantry will never be the same again!
