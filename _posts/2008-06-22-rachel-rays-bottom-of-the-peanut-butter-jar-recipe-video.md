Rather than making you read over the weekend here's a clip for you to watch from Rachel Ray's daytime show where she demonstrates how to make two dessert sauces from the bottom of the peanut butter jar. The two sauces are a Peanut Butter Chocolate Sauce and Peanut Butter Caramel Sauce. 

I know people that claim they are completely inept in the kitchen but I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone that can't make these. You could even whip this up in a basic office kitchen if you're stuck inside on a beautiful summer day. As long as you have a water cooler with a hot water knob, you're all set. She also shows you a "pre-scooping" technique for ice cream that will make serving a bunch of ice cream sundaes for a party all at once go much faster.
