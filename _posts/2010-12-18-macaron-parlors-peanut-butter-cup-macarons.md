I was gifted a box of these lovely <a href="http://www.macaronparlour.com/macarons">Macaron Parlour</a> Peanut Butter Cup Macarons from a friend who owns the fabulous gluten-free cookie brand, <a href="http://www.cavemencookies.com/">Caveman Cookies</a>. And you gotta figure that someone who owns a cookie company would know where to get good cookies, right? I was <em>super</em> excited to try 'em.

Macarons are crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and generally filled with creamy, rich ganache. These particular macarons are filled with both peanut butter and chocolate ganaches - score! It often seems that the chocolate dominates the peanut butter in CPB treats, but in this case the peanut butter is a little more present. I also think that the crunch from the cookie slightly reminds me of the crunch of peanuts. Yum, yum!

A box of these adorable cookies would make a great holiday gift and a nice departure from the usual Christmas butter cookies. Get em at <a href="http://www.macaronparlour.com/macarons">Macaron Parlour</a>. Is there any gift better than an edible gift? I think not! Now if only the wrapping paper were edible... maybe technology will get there some day.

<em>A note to those with allergies: This macaron shell is made with almond flour.</em>

As a little extra bonus since I've written a lot of product-oriented posts lately (and consequently been slacking a bit with the recipes), I'm including a great macaron recipe after the break!

Here's a great recipe for <a href="http://leitesculinaria.com/3324/recipes-french-chocolate-macaroons.html">French Chocolate Macarons</a> from <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/0811835162">Luscious Chocolate Desserts</a> by Lori Longbotham. This is an old shot I snapped when I made them a few years ago. Not bad for a first attempt at macarons.

Bet they'd taste great with peanut butter ganache filling...
