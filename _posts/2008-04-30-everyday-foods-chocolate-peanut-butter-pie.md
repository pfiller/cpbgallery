It's been a few days since I've provided you with a tasty recipe, so here ya go!

Having only two subscriptions to cooking magazines is a self-imposed rule in order to prevent my apartment from being completely taken over with piles of magazines that I can't bring myself to throw out. The two magazines I receive are <a href="http://www.cookinglight.com/cooking/">Cooking Light</a> and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/everydayfood/">Everyday Food</a>. Both offer delicious and (often) quick recipes that are easy to prepare even when you're busy.

Unfortunately I've contradicted myself because I've been too busy for even quick recipes this week. I haven't gotten to make this like I wanted to, but you should! It might even inspire you to pick up a copy or a subscription to this magazine. It's been worth every penny. 

I can't stay away from my kitchen forever, though. Maybe I can fit this in tomorrow...

Recipe after the break.

<strong>Everyday Food's Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie</strong>
Serves 8

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
30 chocolate wafer cookies
4 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted
1 envelope (1/4 oz) unflavored gelatin
3/4 cup packed light-brown sugar
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup chopped peanuts

<strong>Directions</strong>
1. Preheat oven to 350. Place cookies in a food processor, and process until finely ground (you should have 1-3/4 cups); add butter, and pulse until moistened. Transfer crumb mixture to a 9-inch removable-bottom tart pan. Press firmly into the bottom and up the sides (use bottom of a dry measuring cup to help). Bake until fragrant and set, 15 to 20 minutes; let cool completely. Wipe food processor clean, and reserve.

2. Place 1/4 cup cold water in a small saucepan; sprinkle with gelatin. Set aside to soften, 5 to 10 minutes.

3. In food processor, combine sugar and peanut butter; process until smooth. Add cream; process until mixture is light and holds soft peaks, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.

4. Heat softened gelatin over very low heat, stirring, just until dissolved. Add to peanut butter mixture in food processor; blend to combine. Transfer filling to cooled crust, and smooth top. Sprinkle with peanuts, and chill until set, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.
