The caption for this recipe states, "nobody skips breakfast when flaky crescent rolls hold layers of chocolate and banana filling." They forgot to mention the peanut butter, but it's okay - I'm too mesmerized by the deliciously sweet swirls in that pic to care too much. 

I bet this would also be great served warm as a dessert and topped with some ice cream. You could then have leftovers the following morning for breakfast. Moderation, be damned! :)

Ogling the chocolate swirls in the above pic reminded me of the swirls in the fabulous Chocolate Babka from Dean and Deluca.
