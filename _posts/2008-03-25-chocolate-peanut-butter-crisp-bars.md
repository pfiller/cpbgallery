Where does the crisp in these brownies come from?... Well if the above graphic didn't give it away, maybe you don't deserve to know. It's potato chips, of course!

I see a lot of repeated concepts in the world of chocolate and peanut butter treats, but I get a little extra excited to find a recipe with some different technique or ingredient that makes it just a little more special than the rest. 

It seems that this recipe actually has two secret ingredients. The most obvious one is the potato chips, but I also find the sweetened condensed milk being poured over the top of the brownie before baking to be an interesting technique. It sounds like it would come out to being a very moist, chewy brownie with a bit of crunch, a sticky peanut butter topping and a layer of chocolate ganache to boot. This is certainly not your run of the mill brownie out of a box!

It's also nice that this recipe starts with a brownie mix, which saves you a lot of time, and with all the add-ins I'm sure that no one would call you out for cheating. And if they do, they don't get seconds!

I didn't post the photo of these bars because I like pretty pictures on my blog and the recipe only had a very small, not-so-great one. But there is one that accompanies the recipe if you're curious for what they look like.
