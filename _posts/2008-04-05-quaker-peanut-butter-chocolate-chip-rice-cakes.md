I promote a lot of unhealthy foods on this website. This is pretty obvious, given the site's name. What may not be so obvious is that aside from eating rich desserts, I actually eat pretty healthfully on the whole. One of my all time favorite healthy snacks since childhood has been rice cakes. To those non-rice-cake-lovers out there, this might seem like an odd snack to be enthusiastic over, but I love them. I can't explain it. People say they look like styrofoam and well... I don't really have any way to counter that - they do look like styrofoam, but they also have such a nice light texture and taste fantastic with peanut butter. 

My standbys used to be the <a href="http://www.ontrackeveryday.com/products/ricecakes/applecinnamon">Chocolate Crunch</a> or <a href="http://www.ontrackeveryday.com/products/ricecakes/applecinnamon">Apple Cinnamon</a> topped, of course with peanut butter, but as soon as I find these new <a href="http://www.ontrackeveryday.com/products/ricecakes/peanutbutterchocolatechip">Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Rice Cakes</a> at my local store, I think my favorite flavor might change. 

There is apparently a type-o in the nutrition facts on Quaker's site as it says one cake is only 7 calories - 25 from fat. <a href="http://www.calorie-count.com/calories/item/98138.html">Calorie-Count </a>seems to be a more reliable source noting 60 calories per cake. They are a nice way for me to get a chocolate peanut butter fix without taking in an incredible amount of calories.

If the rice cake alone is not indulgent enough for you, fix yourself up a Nutty Chocolate Banana Rice Cake. The recipe is at <a href="http://www.ontrackeveryday.com/recipe/14266">Quaker's "On Track Everyday" Site</a>.

Thanks to my good friend Carla for telling me about these and for sharing my obsession for sweets!
