Tagline: "Protein Nutrition Bar"

When it comes to protein bars, I'll admit it: I judge a protein bar by it's cover. And I'm a little scared off the bat to taste this bar. It's got some bright flashy packaging and on it, it says "16 grams of quality protein." The last bar I tasted with that much protein was the Clif Builder's bar that had 20 grams in it and it tasted like... well... crap. But I'm on a mission to find awesome chocolate peanut butter protein bars (assuming they exist), so I must press on.

This bar has 260 calories (60 from fat) for a 65g (2.3 oz) bar. 

Okay, I'm a bit confused here. This bar says it's peanut butter flavor and it looks peanut butter flavor, but it has a fairly distinct mocha flavor. ...Huh? I also think this bar is misnamed by use of the word "crunch". It's definitely more crispy than crunchy. It's important to be accurate when describing a bar's texture as their textures can be quite unpleasant sometimes.

The base of the bar looks to have that blended bar consistency like that of the powerbar, but it's surprisingly crispy, which I like. It's a peanut butter protein mixture with krispies scattered throughout. A few bites in, I can't stand it any more- what could possibly be causing that mocha taste?!...

Nothing in the ingredients hints to this flavor, or at least, none of the words I understand do. So I can do nothing but eat on. The good news is that the mocha flavor is mostly noticeable with the first few bites. Once you get used to it, and the surprise to your tastebuds passes, the peanut butter flavor becomes much more apparent. The chocolate coating doesn't contribute much flavor as it's either too thin or too waxy or too... bad. 

But somehow overall, I like this bar and I didn't expect to at all. I tend to like the more natural looking bars and cringe a little upon taking the first bite of any bar with the phrase "Performance Bar" on the package. Mostly because the natural ones tend to have ingredients that you know and love scattered throughout while these workout bars have blended hunks of protein - a quality I complain about often. Congrats, GNC ProCrunch, you've embarassed me for my prejudgement.

The next time you walk into a GNC and are battling indecision as you peruse the many shelves stocked with tons of protein bars, grab yourself a <a href="http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2372973&cp=2665513.2844878.2844884&parentPage=family">ProCrunch Peanut Butter Crunch</a>. There's no reason to be scared. I promise!
