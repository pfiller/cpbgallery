Ladies and gentlemen, I realized something very unfortunate today. We are pretty well into summer and I have not yet had an ice cream sandwich! That's just wrong!

The realization came while checking Martha Stewart's <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/cookie-of-the-day?rsc=wn_Homepage_Homepage">Cookie of the Day</a> page, where I found these awesome looking <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/pb-and-j-pops?lnc=ef2e802fb632c110VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&rsc=cookie+of+the+day_recipe_b">PB&J Pops</a>. Now, I love PB&J but I love PB&C <em>more</em> so my brain immediately started contemplating how to convert this treat. It's easy enough: just substitute melted chocolate or a chocolate sauce in place of the jelly. I personally have always loved chocolate chips lining the sides of ice cream sandwiches, so I would prefer to dip them in mini chips instead of chopped nuts. I think it has to do with the nostalgia of the many chocolate chip cookie ice cream  sandwiches I enjoyed over all those summers as a kid. The love for them is ingrained in me forever!

Note: for extra refreshment, you could also add sliced bananas in between the ice cream and chocolate sauce!

The best part about these is that they last up to 2 weeks in the freezer. So you only have to do the work once to have an awesome stash of treats for two whole weeks of summer fun. 

In the hope of preventing others from committing this serious eating offense I hereby declare this "Ice Cream Sandwich Weekend!" Get the recipe at <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/pb-and-j-pops?lnc=ef2e802fb632c110VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&rsc=cookie+of+the+day_recipe_b">Martha Stewart</a> and don't forget to add the chocolate. Enjoy!!
