I realize writing a review of a book before you have finished it is not the norm, but I just had to share this quote from Steve Almond's Candyfreak with you:



<blockquote>"Every now and again, I'll run into someone who claims not to like chocolate or other sweets, and while we live in a country where everyone has the right to eat what they want, I want to say for the record that I don't trust these people, that I think something is wrong with them, and that they're probably - this must be said - total duds in bed." - pg.8</blockquote>



While I'm not sure I've judged people's sex lives in relation to their like or dislike of chocolate (though I may start to do so <em>now</em>, whether intentionally or not), I have definitely eyed people more suspiciously once they've fessed up to not liking it, and laughed out loud at the realization while reading the above excerpt. The dislike of chocolate is something I truly will never understand. And the fact that they think it it no big deal? If you are missing out on such a fantastic thing that the culinary world has to offer- how could you be so indifferent? *Sigh*

I am going to take this opportunity to oust my mother as a peanut butter disliker (I won't say hater, it's just too strong a word when it comes to pb). Yet she spawned me, someone who has been known to eat peanut butter straight out of the jar since childhood. I remember the feeling I'd get when opening up a new jar. Feeling slightly sad at piercing the beautiful plateau of smooth peanut butter, but excited to dig in to a fresh jar just the same. And <a href="http://americancandy.de/images/smuckers_goober_grape.jpg">the peanut butter that was mixed with grape jelly</a>? Oh man was that a treat. Trying to get the peanut butter and jelly to make some kind of crazy swirl on my spoon? Sure it would inevitably get eaten but when it looked pretty, it was all the more fun. But I'm descending into a tangent- How could this happen - me having a peanut butter disliking mom? All I have to say mom is, shame on you!

Buy the very funny Candyfreak at <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/0156032937/103-8370542-8519815">Amazon</a> and remember to appreciate (chocolate and peanut butter) candy.
