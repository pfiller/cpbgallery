Just LOOK at that spoonful! Rainbow colors from the reeses pieces, swirls of peanut butter, chunks of Butterfinger. Oh. Man.

I offered to pick up a Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake from Cold Stone for Taste Tester the other night, which turned out to be a bad idea because I was tempted to get myself something as well. What flavors caught my eye? Not one, but two new peanut butter treats. Here are details on the new <a href="http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/promotions.html">Nutter Butter Ice Cream</a>:



<blockquote>"Throughout the month of September, Cold Stone Creamery will be selling Make-A-Wish wall stars to benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation, an organization that grants wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions. Be sure to visit your local Cold Stone Creamery to try two new flavors, Nutter Butter® and Marshmallow, and the very special “Make-A-Wish Creations” inspired by Jack and Emily, two Wish Children.

<strong>Jack's Creation</strong> - Marshmallow ice cream with OREO® Cookies, Chocolate Chips and Fudge
<strong>Emily's Creation</strong> - Nutter Butter® ice cream with White Chocolate Chips, Kit Kat® and Yellow Cake"</blockquote>



I walked out that night with just the chocolate peanut butter milkshake, but thought about trying their new flavors every day after that. Finally a week later I marched right back into Cold Stone and got myself a <strong>Peanut Butter Gallery Sundae</strong> (was that flavor named for me or what?). I'm not sure if this is something that's posted at all of their stores, but they had the combo written on their "For Fun" Board. This glorious combination which you can see in the photo above is made of peanut butter ice cream, peanut butter, Reeses PB Cups, Reeses Pieces, Butterfingers and (this wasn't included, but I had to add it because I can't get icecream without it) chocolate syrup.

Um... YUM?!!

I was a little hesitant to get this flavor because I thought that peanut butter ice cream with extra peanut butter might actually be too much. Wow, was I wrong. I guess this proves you really can't have too much of good ol' pb.

After re-reading the explanation for the flavor while writing this post, I guess I should have gone with the Nutter Butter Sundae to help benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation, but correcting my mistake is just the little bit of incentive I need to return to Cold Stone and get it the next time around! Hurry and get yours before September is over.
