This will be the second time I profess my love of rice cakes. Is it weird to love a food that resembles styrofoam? Maybe, but I can't help it. 

After since finding out about these on the web and writing a <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/05/quaker-peanut-butter-chocolate-chip-rice-cakes/">previous post</a> about them, I have been checking in every grocery store I've come across searching for them. But it seems they are no where to be found. Did they decide that New Jersey was not worthy of them? I'm going to take this opportunity to reach out to Quaker and plead that they please start distributing this product to the NY/NJ area. Pretty please?

My long time friend and fellow sweets addict, Carla of <a href="http://www.carlascupcakery.com/">Carla's Cupcakery</a> in Florida was kind enough to ship me a couple bags of them. I've been shipped chocolate, cookies, granola bars, even cupcakes but never rice cakes, so kudos to her for being the first to do that for me.

Part of the reason I love rice cakes is that I am a habitual snacker. So sometimes even when I'm not that hungry I end up snacking just because I want to. This, obviously can be a bad habit and make you gain weight. However, rice cakes are so low in calories that I feel like I can snack on them all day long and not worry that I'm going to tip the scales. And what's great about this flavor is that it's got that nice peanut butter coating and it's topped with lots of mini chocolate chips, so you don't even feel the need to top it with any kind of spread.

Look at all those nooks and crannies! Wait, wrong catch phrase. Moving on...

My only complaint about rice cakes is that they crunch so loud that I am a little embarrassed to eat them at work and disturb the pseudo silence that's typically present in the office. The crunch is far less disturbing when eating the smaller sized rice cakes (aka <a href="http://www.ontrackeveryday.com/products/tastyflavors">Quakes</a>), but they have yet to release the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip flavor in that size. The larger ones, including these stay at home where they can be slathered in peanut butter or whatever else is in my pantry, but like I said, in this case toppings are not necessary. Though Carla has told me multiple times that they taste great with peanut butter, marshmallow fluff and bananas, so I may have to try that combo and report back!

Go on a wild goose chase to every super market in your general area in order to track these down, or beg your friend in Florida to ship some to you. They're worth the trouble.
