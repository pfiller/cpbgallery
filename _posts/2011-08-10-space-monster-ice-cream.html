Hey there! I know, I know it's been too long. Truth be told, I've been holed away eating only ice cream for a month straight. Nom Nom NOM!

I'm kidding. (Though maybe I wish I wasn't… that sounds pretty awesome!) Remember how Taste Tester and I <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/10/26/a-chocolatey-proposal/">got engaged in a chocolate factory</a>? Well we finally decided to get married. Yay! So I'm knee deep in wedding planning. Things have been busy, but I wanted to say a little hello and let you in on one of my favorite summer 2011 snacks. Of course it's cold and refreshing to combat the summer heat and full of CPB to combat my ferocious cravings!

One of my favorite ice cream flavors is undoubtably coffee. So imagine my delight on a recent visit to adorable old-school Brooklyn ice creamery <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-farmacy-and-soda-fountain-brooklyn">Farmacy & Soda Fountain</a> to discover that they serve theirs with peanut butter. Their Peanut Butter Cup Sundae consists of "peanut butter, coffee ice cream and hot fudge topped with whipped cream & shaved chocolate." I ordered it out of total curiosity - would it be so ill-matched that it'd ruin my favorite ice cream flavor forever? Or would it be so good I'd want to marry <em>IT</em> instead?. Thankfully, the combo did not disappoint and I have been making my own version with regularity at home.

Obviously my presentation could use some work, but when you're busy and craving something tasty, sometimes… that just doesn't matter. I enjoyed every hideous bite of this delicious space monster-esque dessert. And you will too!

So treat yourself to a big giant scoop of coffee ice cream (in my case, <a href="http://www.starbucksicecream.com/#/our_ice_cream/java_chip_frappucino/">Starbucks Java Chip</a>), chopped malted milk balls and peanut butter (I went with straight up Jif). You can melt the pb in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it and get maximum coverage out of it. Any fine <a href="http://tvmedia.ign.com/tv/image/article/742/742680/thesimpsons-hungryarethedamned_1162263247.jpg">foodie space monster</a> would expect no less!

I meant human - any fine human would expect no less. Right.

Happy Eating!
