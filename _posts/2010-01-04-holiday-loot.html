Oh, how I love this time of year. You get to spend a little extra time with your family and friends and of course, eat your heart out. Here are some tasty treats I've gotten ahold of throughout the holidays:

I had seen <a href="http://www.yopeanut.com/news/index.asp">the callout</a> for <a href="http://www.yopeanut.com/">Saratoga Peanut Butter Company</a> in <a href="http://www.rachaelraymag.com/">Everyday with Rachael Ray</a> a while back but didn't know where to find their peanut butters. Luckily for me, a good friend found it and gave me a jar of their <a href="http://www.yopeanut.com/our-products/index.asp">Maple Peanut Butter</a>! I love it - it's not too sweet like a lot of flavored peanut butters can be, it's a little chunky and it has a really pleasant earthy maple flavor. It even smells strongly of maple syrup when you open the jar! I spread it on some freshly baked shortbread cookies I had lying around and it was mmm mmm good!

The same friend gave me a <a href="http://www.mastbrotherschocolate.com/home.html">Mast Brother's Cacao, Cane Sugar Bar</a>. Their packaging is so pretty that I actually feel guilty tearing it open. I thought the bar was okay, though it was oddly hard to bite into. It was also a touch too waxy, which kept the flavor from hitting my tongue for at least a few seconds. Once the waxiness subsided, I thought it had a nice flavor but it melted really slowly and the bits of chocolate that stayed intact in my mouth made for an odd texture. I think that means it has a high melting point? I'm still learning the chocolate lingo... It's good chocolate, I'm just not sure it deserves all of the raves it gets.

My friend Kathy of <a href="http://www.kathleensconfections.com/">Kathleen's Confections</a> sent me some fun old-school candy bars including the <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/07/18/necco-sky-bar-review/">SkyBar</a>, <a href="http://www.googoo.com/GooGooproduct.asp">GooGoo Peanut Butter</a> and a <a href="http://www.typetive.com/candyblog/item/rocky_road_supreme_peanut_butter/">Rocky Road Supreme Peanut Butter</a> (see photo above) for Christmas. I am saving these chocolates until we get back from our trip to the Chicago area, but after reading <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/01/candyfreak-by-steve-almond/">Candyfreak</a> last year, I've had a newfound appreciation for nostalgic treats and look forward to giving them a try.

As for baked holiday goodies, one of Taste Tester's family members brought over a batch of <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/03/02/good-ol-fashioned-fill-in-the-blank/">classic chocolate peanut butter thumbprints</a> for Christmas that I've been happily gobbling up! 

And finally, here's a list of what I've made. I recommend you try all of these!
