Hey guys, I know I've been a little sluggish with the posts in the last week. I started a new job so things have been busy, but bear with me because I've got some great stuff coming this week... starting with this awesome Chocolate Peanut Butter Bombe Ice Cream Cake!

Going from the inside out, the layers of this cake are dulce de leche ice cream with chopped snickers bars swimming throughout, peanut butter ice cream, peanut butter chocolate dessert topping and the bottom of the cake is a crust of crushed peanut butter sandwich cookies. Wow!

And what's great about this dessert is that it could be considered more of an outline than an exact recipe, because you can use whatever flavor cookies, chopped candy bar or ice cream that you like! Although come to think of it, the combination of peanut butter and dulce de leche ice cream sounds really interesting. Hmm... mini malt balls would be awesome swimming throughout the cake as well...

I've never made one of these bombe cakes and I'm not sure why. It's got just five - count em - five ingredients, sounds fairly easy to make and sounds like there's not much room for error. If your "Bombe" doesn't look that smooth on the outside, just coat it with some ganache, sprinkles or cookie crumbs to hide it's faults and no one would be the wiser. Plus you know when you cut a slice of the cake and reveal all of it's wonderful layers, your guests will ooh and ahh. 

This is the perfect chocolate peanut butter summer party dessert - so make it before summer slips away! Get the recipe at <a href="http://www.womansday.com/Recipes/Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Bombe">Woman's Day</a>.
