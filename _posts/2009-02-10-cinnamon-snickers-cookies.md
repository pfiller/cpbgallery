This cookie doesn't really taste like any other cookie I've had before. The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like Cinnamon Toast Crunch in cookie form with Snickers Bars mixed in. Can you imagine that? If not, it might be because you haven't tasted anything like it either. The oats give the cookie some density and the cinnamon and brown sugar definitely evoke the flavor of that beloved adult... I mean, <em>kid</em> cereal.  

I guess these do not technically have peanut <em>butter</em> in them, but the peanuts from the snickers give it that wonderful peanutty touch. The texture is soft but slightly dense and you get a nice, crunchy bite here and there from a bit of the caramel that has managed to leak out and harden up during baking.

The dough comes together so fast that you could easily whip these up on a weeknight, as I did. You will love them, I promise. Get the recipe from <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Championship-Cookies/Detail.aspx">Allrecipes</a>.
