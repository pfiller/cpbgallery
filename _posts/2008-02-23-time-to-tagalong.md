It's that time of year again. Valentine's Day has come and gone and so has your heart shaped box of truffles. Finding yourself in need of a sweet fix? What better way to satisfy it than by eating tasty cookies that support the Girl Scouts of America?

For those of you that aren't familiar with the tagalong, um... is there anyone out there that doesn't know what they taste like? It's a shortbread type cookie with a layer of peanut butter filling all surrounded by chocolate. I generally prefer softer cookies, but the Tagalong is a nice contrast of textures with a crunchy cookie bottom and soft peanut butter top that your teeth sink into. 

I grew up knowing them as peanut butter patties, but whatever they're called, they're great. While they may not be my favorite Girl Scout cookie, being up against the ever stiff competition of the glorious Samoa, they hold a special place in my heart as the second favorite.
