I noticed an ad for this tasty looking chocolate peanut butter bundt cake on <a href="http://www.rachaelraymag.com/">Rachael Ray's site</a>. I'm going to assume that the use of the word, 'nirvana' means that it will help bring you to some kind of chocolate peanut butter superhuman bliss. Then again, maybe the recipe's creators were just rocking out to a little 90's grunge when they came up with the recipe. Who knows. Either way, I thought it would be a nice excuse to dedicate a post to one of my favorite peanut butters: Jif.
