Get in the kitchen because everyone's favorite <em>(pea)</em>nut house, <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter & Co</a> recently announced a new Holiday-themed contest! And you're hearing about it just in time to enter and win a peanut buttery prize! Who's going to be thinking up peanut butter treats instead of getting their work done today? You are! Just remember, no sandwiches allowed - sorry, <a href="http://www.wordsources.info/words-mod-sandwich.html">Earl</a> but they already did a sandwich contest.

The official <a href="http://blog.ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter & Co Blog</a> reports that, "In this contest anything goes - desserts, side dishes, main courses, you name it. Have a crazy idea for a Peanut Butter Roast Chicken? Let’s see it! Secretly plotting a Peanut Butter Fondue? Let us know." For full contest details, <a href="http://blog.ilovepeanutbutter.com/2008/11/05/holiday-recipe-contest/">visit their blog</a>.

<strong>Deadline:</strong> "We’ll be awarding TWO prizes for this contest - The first winner will be announced on <strong>November 18th</strong>, in time for Thanksgiving. The second winner will be announced on <strong>December 18th</strong>, just before Christmas and Hanukkah. Winners receive a special Holiday Peanut Butter & Co. prize pack. All entries will be eligible for both deadlines, so no need to enter twice!"

Peanut butter green bean casserole, anyone? Hmm... maybe I'll leave this one to you...
