No, you didn't end up on some other blog. We've seriously got some bacon today on The CPB Gallery. This photo was found on flickr by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/exoskeletoncabaret/2827329336/">exoskeletoncabaret</a>.

Of the recipe, she says, "The original peanut butter cup recipe came from <a href="http://havecakewilltravel.com/2008/08/29/pb-cups/">have cake, will travel!</a>. I improved upon the ingredients by using organic, natural peanut butter, dark semi-bitter chocolate, and of course...crisp applewood-smoked bacon on top. These cups were made with regular-sized cupcake papers, not minis. Wee bacon-chocolates would be a tease." 

She then notes, "ARR UM NUM NUM." Couldn't have said it better myself.

I've tried bacon chocolate a couple of times, first with a bar called the <a href="http://www.cocorouge.com/chocolatebar/#">Carnassier</a> at <a href="http://www.cocorouge.com/">Coco Rouge</a> in Chicago with my friend Kathy. This is her trying to make her mind up about the combination:

I think she had the reaction most people would have when trying to humor a chocolate loving friend, which is, "It's... interesting... yeah....................... <em>actually</em> I don't really think I like it."

I on the other hand enjoyed it, but of course I like chocolate with salty things and bacon is quite salty. I'm not going to try to tell you that you'll love this combination but I will try to tell you to at least give it a try. Could you really continue the rest of your life NOT knowing how chocolate and bacon tastes? I sure couldn't.

One of my favorite parts of having a relatively harmless looking chocolate bar with bacon was to offer it to people without telling them there was bacon inside. You couldn't do the same with this peanut butter cup because of the way it is decorated but, that's probably for the best. I'd like to keep my friends, after all.
