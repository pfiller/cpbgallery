The description for this cookie recipe reads, "These are THE BEST cookies I have ever eaten. They are a definite hit. If you like peanut butter and chocolate - these cookies are for you!" 

Since it sounded like whoever wrote this was talking directly to me, I knew I'd have to make them!

It was great having all that candy around for Easter but the daunting task of consuming it became even too much for my sweet tooth. So I made use of some peanut butter cups laying around and stuck them in some tasty cookies to share with Taste Tester's coworkers. I found <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Cup-Cookies/Detail.aspx">the perfect recipe</a> on Allrecipes and got to work.

There's a little bit of chopping involved to prep the Reese's (unless you have the cute little bite-sized cups) but otherwise these cookies come together pretty quickly. 

These tasty treats were crispy on the outside and soft and slightly chewy on the inside. Creaming the butter and sugars really well and sifting the flower created a dough that turned out very light. They seemed unusually light for a peanut butter cookie which made it easy to continually pop them in your mouth without making you feel too weighed down. Whether you think that's wonderful or completely torturous I'm going to assume is personal preference. I thought it was wonderful!

These were tasty and a great way to use up extra post-holiday candy. Check out <a href="http://lunchstudio.blogspot.com/2010/04/400pm-chocolate-and-peanut-butter.html">Front Studio</a> for a review of them and get the modified recipe after the break!

Before baking these, I read a few of the user reviews on Allrecipes that advised omitting or reducing the amount of cocoa powder in the recipe. I followed the suggestion and posted the adjustment below, but otherwise followed the original recipe.

<strong>Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup Cookies</strong>
slightly modified from <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Cup-Cookies/Detail.aspx">Allrecipes</a>
Recipe says it yields 36 but I got close to 50...?

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 Tbsp cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup peanut butter chips
10 chocolate covered peanut butter cups, cut into eighths

<strong>Directions</strong>
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, and baking soda; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and peanut butter cups. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.

3. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven (mine took 12-13). Let cool for 1 or 2 minutes on sheet before removing, or they will fall apart.
