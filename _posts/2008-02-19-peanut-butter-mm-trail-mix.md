I feel like whenever I buy a bag of trail mix there's one thing in the bag that I don't like and try to eat around. Of course I inevitably end up consuming it anyway and thinking "blegh" every time one evades rejection. This is a recipe for trail mix that has everything I like and is an easy enough formula so that you can replace things if you'd rather use something else. Recipe after the break.

It makes enough to fill 5 four ounce baggies. So it will keep you snacking for the entire work week! Unless of course you have no self control and eat it all in a sitting... not my fault!

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
5 sandwich ziploc bags (not for eating!)
1 cup mini honey teddy grahams
1 cup peanut butter m&ms
1 cup sweetened banana chips
2/3 cup cocktail peanuts
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut chips
1/2 cup raisins

<strong>Directions</strong>
Mix all of the ingredients in a bowl and separate into baggies. Or if you're concerned about even distribution, just lay out all 5 baggies, and distribute each ingredient evenly into each as you measure them out. No one wants to be cheated out of their m&ms!!
