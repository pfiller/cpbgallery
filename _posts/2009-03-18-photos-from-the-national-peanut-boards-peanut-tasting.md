After writing that I didn't have many pictures from <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/03/10/the-national-peanut-boards-peanut-tasting-event-in-nyc/">The NPB's Peanut Tasting Event</a>, a few people kindly contacted me with photos of various products that were served or given out in goodie bags at the event. So sorry for the delay in postings, but I've been busy writing big long posts about said products (complete with pictures!) and they take a big long time to write. They will be up soon - I promise!

I also found some photos from the tasting at <a href="http://blondieandbrownie.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-love-peanuts-and-peanuts-love-me.html">Blondie and Brownie</a>. In <a href="http://blondieandbrownie.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-love-peanuts-and-peanuts-love-me.html">their write-up</a>, there's also a few shots of the peanut event at Grand Central Station, which I wasn't able to attend. It's pretty cool to see a peanut farm in the middle of a busy NYC train station.

In the meantime I'll leave you with this adorable image that I found this morning:

<a href="http://www.littlepaperplanes.com/product/1881-theres-a-chocolate-eating-mouse-in-my-house-print"><img src="http://www.littlepaperplanes.com/assets/images/3085_w450.jpg" alt="chocolate mouse" /></a>

I love this print because my mom nicknamed me "The Mouse" growing up due to my elusive snacking style. Where did that entire bag of chocolate chips go? I haven't the slightest idea. ;)

Having grown up with a back yard that had woods and a creek, we came to meet a few mice over the years and happen to know that they <em>love</em> chocolate and peanut butter. Since they are CPB lovers, it seems only fair to mention them in this blog, even if they are pilfering from our beloved stashes. This mouse apparently prefers c over pb. You can buy a print of this painting by <a href="http://www.kellylasserre.com/">Kelly Lasserre</a> at <a href="http://www.littlepaperplanes.com/product/1881-theres-a-chocolate-eating-mouse-in-my-house-print">Little Paper Planes</a>.
