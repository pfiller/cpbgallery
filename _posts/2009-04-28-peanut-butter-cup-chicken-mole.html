As you can probably imagine, I've come across lots of crazy chocolate peanut butter recipes at this point in my blog adventure. Some are crazy in an awesome way and some are just plain crazy. I can't quite decide which category this one fits into, but I know that it spiked my curiosity.

This is probably the first savory recipe I've come across that is made with Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. For those of you who are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(sauce)">mole</a> virgins, both peanut butter and chocolate are perfectly normal ingredients in this dish. However, I've never seen both used together and think that using Reeses PB Cups gives the recipe a fun twist. Because even if they melt into the sauce and become indistinguishable in the end, it's just kind of fun knowing that you're eating candy for dinner. Most mole recipes seem to call for cocoa powder or dark chocolate, which would deepen the flavor of the dish, but I think the addition of espresso powder in RR's recipe would provide the richness and depth of flavor that's normally supplied by a darker source of chocolate.

<strong>Epilogue:</strong> While writing this post, I kind of convinced myself that this would be a good dish, but then my mind wandered a little and once you mix peanut butter cups and chicken, it kind of makes you wonder about the out-there concoctions all this culinary creativity might lead us to...
