Hey there, I'm back! I'm happy to return to the blog, though a little sad to report that I only found 1 single jar of peanut butter over the course of two whole weeks in Spain. My European readers weren't kidding when they said it was hard to find! On the bright side at least the spanish like their chocolate and pastries, so we found plenty of those.

I have a bunch to share about the trip but for now I'm going to celebrate my return to the US (and its readily available peanut butter) with my very first chocolate peanut butter giveaway! How exciting! And it's not from just anyone - we're giving away goodies from one of my favorite snack companies: <a href="http://www.naturevalley.com/">Nature Valley</a>. Yum!!

Nature Valley, maker of super-tasty granola bars was kind enough to share two excellent new products with me. They recently released these Granola Thins, which come in both <a href="http://www.naturevalley.com/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductId=38">peanut butter</a> and <a href="http://www.naturevalley.com/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductId=37">dark chocolate</a>.

Nature Valley makes healthy and convenient snacks that are really tasty and satisfying. I am one of those people that can - I will admit - get a little cranky if hunger strikes when there's no food in sight, and their bars (safely stashed in my purse) have saved me on plenty of occasions.

<strong>What makes Granola Thins different than other Granola Bars?</strong>
These Granola Thins are a little different than the typical log-shaped granola bars that you're used to. Crunchy, nutty and packed with oats, they are similar in texture to Nature Valley's <a href="http://www.naturevalley.com/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductId=9">Oats 'N Honey Crunchy Granola Bars</a>, but thinner and lined with a layer of either rich dark chocolate or luscious peanut butter. It's a satisfying, low-calorie snack with a little indulgence.

So who's hungry? Let's get to the giveaway!

<strong>The Nature Valley Giveaway Prize Pack includes:</strong> 
• A box of Dark Chocolate Granola Thins (includes 10 Thins)
• A box of Peanut Butter Granola Thins (includes 10 Thins)

<strong>And the giveaway rules are:</strong>
In order to choose a winner, I love to hear from my readers (those that I know or those that I don't) so I'm going to just ask you drop me a line. I get a pretty good amount of traffic here on the blog, but a lot of you never say hi! Are you closeted chocolate peanut butter fans? Don't be ashamed! Chocolate and peanut butter should be celebrated at all times! Say hello via twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/cpbgallery">@cpbgallery</a> or in the comments section below.

<strong>Here is some inspiration if you don't know what to say:</strong>
• Just simply, say hello! :) or Trick or Treat!
• Share why you love Nature Valley products or granola bars in general.
• Share what you love about chocolate & peanut butter!
• For the advanced commenter: share a haiku about granola bars and/or chocolate & peanut butter. Incase you don't know or need a refresh, haikus are 17 syllable poems divided into 3 phrases: 5 syllables, 7, then another 5.

The winner will be announced on Tuesday, October 26, 2010. I look forward to hearing from you!

Thanks to <a href="http://www.naturevalley.com/Default.aspx">Nature Valley</a> for sharing the deliciousness!
