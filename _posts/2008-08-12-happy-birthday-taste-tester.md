Yes that's right, it's birthday week here at The CPB Gallery. My birthday was two days ago, and the ever awesome Taste Tester's birthday is today. We kind of call the in between day "our birthday day" so we end up celebrating three days in a row... with lots of dessert. 

So in honor of our birthdays, go out and find (or bake) yourself something delicious. You can pretend it's your birthday if it makes you feel less guilty. <a href="http://cafejohnsonia.blogspot.com/2008/03/chocolate-peanut-butter-mousse-cake.html">This insane cake</a> looks worthy of a chocolate peanut butter freak like Taste Tester, wouldn't you say?
