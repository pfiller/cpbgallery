I never got around to posting a cute easter dessert to make. Sorry! If you're like me and don't have anything to whip up and bring to a relative's house, why not swing by your local grocery store or pharmacy and grab a bag of Easter candy? Forget the Peeps this year, here are some readily available chocolate and peanut butter varieties. Crisis averted!

- Butterfinger Creme Eggs
- M&Ms Peanut Butter Spectacular Eggs
- Reeses Peanut Butter Eggs
- Reeses Pieces Pastel Eggs

I know I <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/?p=113">swore off Reeses Peanut Butter Cups after discovering the Vosges Peanut Butter Bonbon</a>, but that doesn't mean <em>you</em> can't have them. Also, the Reeses Peanut Butter Egg was always my favorite Easter candy so it has a bit of a nostalgic attraction to it.

If you <del datetime="2008-03-22T01:35:34+00:00">want to take the fun out of Easter candy</del> are concerned of possible weight gain while consuming various Easter treats, you can consult the <a href="http://www.cyberdiet.com/reg/dietwatch/holidays/easter/candyCounter/candyCounter.cgi">Easter Candy Counter</a> to determine how much exercise you need to do to burn all of the calories off. I'd personally much rather burn them off in an Easter egg hunt or egg rolling contest myself, but do whatever makes you happy.

Happy Easter!
