Butterfinger & cream cheese frosting??!! Is that legal?

Butterfingers are super. And don't let your "friends" tell you otherwise. Sure it's a bit annoying when they get stuck on your teeth, but come on, man up. They are worth it, people!

Fine if you're going to be <em>that</em> sensitive about it, go pick yourself up a <a href="http://www.butterfinger.com/ButterfingerCrisp.aspx">Butterfinger Crisp</a> bar instead. It's like all the fun of a Butterfinger, without the teeth trauma. Wuss.
