<a href="http://vicariousfoodie.blogspot.com/2008/04/tagged.html">Vicarious Foodie</a> is a blog that features all sorts of yummy delicious recipes, a lot (maybe all?) of which are from or based on recipes from the peeps over at Food Network. Check out her blog and make something tasty like <a href="http://vicariousfoodie.blogspot.com/2008/04/wild-cherry-m-cookies.html">Wild Cheery M&M Cookies</a>. She also writes lots of fun posts about pasta including <a href="http://vicariousfoodie.blogspot.com/2008/03/noodle-love-iv-penne.html">Baked Penne with Roasted Vegetables</a>, if you're into that kind of thing (who isn't?!).

But, I'm here to do more than just offer her some flattery. :) She's tagged me for the six word memoir game! I've been seeing this around blog-land and am happy to participate. So, here are 6 words that describe me:

curious
daydreamer
busy
preoccupied 
confused
easily amused

When I first started the list, all of my words were too positive for fear of revealing my true self. But then I looked back at Vicarious Foodie and noticed she had been very honest with her words so it seemed that it would be fair to follow suit. 

I tag the following blogs to play along:
<a href="http://www.peanutbutterboy.com/">Peanut Butter Boy</a>
<a href="http://www.foodaphilia.com/">Foodaphilia</a>
<a href="http://www.pilliebee.blogspot.com/">Pilliebee</a>
<a href="http://elbetter.com/">Elbetter</a>
<a href="http://lovelikeavegan.wordpress.com/">Love Like a Vegan</a>
<a href="http://havecakewilltravel.com/">Have Cake, Will Travel</a>

I also want to take a minute to thank anyone that's been reading, commenting on, and supporting The Chocolate Peanut Butter Gallery. It's been an interesting and yummy little experiment and one that I have been enjoying every day. I hope you are enjoying visiting it as much as I am enjoying seeking out tasty things to babble about!

Thanks :)
