So there's this little thing called "Frozen Hot Chocolate" at this little place called "Serendipity 3" in this little town called New York City. Maybe you've heard of it.

It seems that the second a restaurant in NYC (or anywhere, I'd assume) gets featured in a movie, it's the new tourist hot spot. Well <a href="http://www.serendipity3.com/">Serendipity 3</a> was featured in the movie... <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240890/">Serendipity</a> with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. Serendipity came out in 2001 and ever since then, the similarly named cafe has been a tourist spot with crazy lines - not unlike a certain famous cupcakery. I've never been to Serendipity because I don't have very much patience for the tourist spots in NYC but came across <a href="http://www.grouprecipes.com/35112/serendipitys-frozen-peanut-butter-hot-chocolate.html">this recipe online for their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate</a>... oh yeah... and this version's got a bit of peanut butter in it. :D

While I still don't understand why this dessert is called "Frozen Hot Chocolate" instead of a milkshake (*cough* gimmick *cough*) it sounds real tasty, which is reason enough for me to try it. At home. With no lines or tourists.

The movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsjR5P3TuWY">looks lame</a> but at least we got a dessert out of it!
