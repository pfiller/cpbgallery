It's Friday, so you should take five!

I only discovered the <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/products/details/take5.asp">Take 5</a> candy bar a year or two ago, but have been hooked ever since. Chocolate, peanut butter, pretzels, caramel, peanuts... oh man. And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, someone turned it into a cookie!

It's a peanut butter cookie with chocolate chunks and salty pretzels mixed into the dough, and when cooled, you drizzle caramel all over the top. I mean seriously, are you drooling yet? If not, you might not be human. Maybe you should check your pulse.

Check out the recipe over at <a href="http://www.cookiemadness.net/?p=1558">Cookie Madness</a>. You should peruse other recipes on the site if you are a cookie lover because it's very appropriately named.
