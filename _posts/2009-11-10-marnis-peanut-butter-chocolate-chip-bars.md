I have a problem, and if you're a blog reader / recipe lover (I assume you are if you're reading this), then you may be able to relate. My problem is this: I bookmark way too many recipes. Way more than I'll probably ever be able to make, but I love browsing recipe sites and blogs and before I know it, I'm adding yet another delicious treat to my never-ending list of things to bake.

One day recently, I finally found the time to make a recipe that had been on my long, long list for a long, long time. The second I saw Marni's <a href="http://www.happygomarni.com/2009/09/peanut-butter-chocolate-chip-bars.html">Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Bars</a>, I knew I had to have them. As she puts it, 

<blockquote>"They are chewy and gooey and peanutbuttery and exactly what I, as a chocolate peanut butter worshiper, am looking for. If you belong to that camp, too, then indulge yourself and make these. They are incredibly easy to prepare and use basic ingredients you're bound to have handy."</blockquote>

 I think it's safe to say that I too am a "Chocolate Peanut Butter Worshiper", what do you think?

Taste Tester enjoyed these bars so much that right after we polished off the last bar and I was looking to bake something new, he asked if I could make them again. I think it's safe to say that we are creatures of habit - and that these are really, really good.
