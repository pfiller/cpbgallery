Motivated by a chocolate peanut butter craving, Taste Tester and I wandered into Ridgewood, NJ last night - and I do mean <em>wandered</em>. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/van-dyke-ice-cream-ridgewood">Van Dyk's Ice Cream</a>  is tucked away off the beaten path but well worth seeking out. I had been there once a few years ago, tasted their fantastic ice cream and have had dreams of it ever since. They sell homemade ice cream and one fantastic chocolate peanut butter milkshake.

I asked where on the list Taste Tester thought it should be ranked and (in between sips) he said, "I'd eat this before I'd eat Johnny Rockets and Potbelly" so I assume this takes over in the number 3 spot, knocking Johnny Rockets out of the Top 5. He made note that it's not really a fair comparison since the JR and Potbelly versions don't have peanut butter, but I think it's still fair to compare based on texture, creaminess and the intensity of the chocolate flavor.

The reason it's so good, is that not only is it made with homemade ice cream, but the peanut butter they use gives it an awesome flavor. I'm convinced they use roasted salted nuts because the peanut butter flavor has just the perfect amount of salt and the nutty flavor is so intense. I've never had peanut butter in ice cream that stood out so well. I actually uttered, "WHOA" after tasting it.

Also, I know I keep talking about shakes and not posting pictures of them. It's just that it's hard to make a photo of a chocolate peanut butter shake that's in a styrofoam cup look nice. And if I steal Taste Tester's shake away long enough to take pictures of it, he gets cranky. I don't like getting in between a man and his chocolate peanut butter shake. Maybe some day I'll figure that out.
