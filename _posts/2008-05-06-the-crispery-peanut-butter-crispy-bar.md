If you are a frequent CPBG reader, you may have heard me mention my taste tester at some point. Whenever I'm out shopping, I browse around for treats to pick up for me (of course!), but I also keep an eye out for things to buy for him. He deserves it as he lends his taste buds to help me out quite often. 

On <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/05/05/midtown-manhattan-candy-store-tour/">my recent trip to Dylan's Candy Bar</a>, I noticed a whole bunch of giant crispy treats sold at the cafe in the store's top floor. While I can't say they are his favorite dessert, they probably make the top ten - maybe even the top five. I couldn't help but grab a couple. 

I left the store with a <a href="http://www.thecrispery.com/treat.cfm?ProdID=38&category=4">Chocolate Dipped Crispy</a> and a <a href="http://www.thecrispery.com/treat.cfm?ProdID=28&category=4">Chocolate Cookie and Marshmallow Crispy</a>, not realizing until I got home and searched their site that they also make a <a href="http://www.thecrispery.com/treat.cfm?ProdID=30&category=4">Peanut Butter Crispy</a>!

It's hard to describe what makes their product so much better than your average packaged rice krispie treat. Do they whip the marshmallow like crazy to give it that very airy texture? Do they use homemade marshmallows? The treats are so moist it almost tastes like they mix marshmallow fluff in somehow. But, the treats aren't sticky enough for that, so...? Hmph! This is hard.

Whatever their technique, kudos to them because they make a great product. On the <a href="http://www.thecrispery.com/about.cfm">about</a> section of their website, Vicki Mate states right off the bat that she is obsessed with marshmallow. This is exactly what you want to hear from a person who runs a company that produces a marshmallow-y treat. 

It's also clear that she loves marshmallow simply judging by the ratio of marshmallow to cereal. Your average crispy bar has a lot of marshmallow, but it's used more as a glue for the crispies. Hers overflows with marshmallow, making it softer and chewier as opposed to the slightly crunchy crispie treat.

And the treats are so large, we cut one horizontally into four rectangles which made for easy sharing. Though, she is right when she says that you may not want to share, so maybe pick up a few extras when you are placing your order.

After tasting their Chocolate Dipped Crispy Bar and realizing how great a crispy treat can be, I'll have to get my hands on their Peanut Butter Bar! Buy yourself one at their <a href="http://www.thecrispery.com/treat.cfm?ProdID=30&category=4">site</a>.
