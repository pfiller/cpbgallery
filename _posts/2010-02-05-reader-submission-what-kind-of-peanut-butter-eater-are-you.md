The wonderful Marni of <a href="http://www.happygomarni.com/">Happy Go Marni</a> informed me of a fun peanut butter-related post on <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/01/the-different-types-of-peanut-butter-eaters.html">Serious Eats</a>, written by Peanut Butter Enthusiast Lee Zalben of <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/">PB&Co</a>. In the post, Lee ponders people's various peanut butter eating habits.

With about 100 comments following the article, people clearly have an opinion. Quite a few comments reference my favorite combination, c&pb. One lady even puts peanut butter on Mint Oreos! Slightly strange maybe, but to quote this week's 30 Rock, "everyone has their vice."

I found this comment so sad: "I don't think I've ever eaten it straight from the jar in my whole long life." Really? What's wrong with you, lady? Live your life to the fullest! Grab a spoon - you can do it!

So... <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/01/the-different-types-of-peanut-butter-eaters.html">what kind are you?</a>

This post leads me to wonder what kind of chocolate eaters we are. As for me, I think some of the categories I may fit into are Hoarder, Nibbler, Devourer...

Thanks to <a href="http://www.happygomarni.com/">Marni</a> for sharing!
