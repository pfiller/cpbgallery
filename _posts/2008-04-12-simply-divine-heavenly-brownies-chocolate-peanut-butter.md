For a little light weekend reading, here is a love story for you:



<blockquote>"Hand in hand, P. Nut Butter and Choc O. Late dance through this brownie ballroom. The perfect couple twists and turns to the confectionery beat of peanut butter cups and the symphony of peanut butter frosting."</blockquote>



That is a quote from Simply Divine's official website. Have you ever heard a sexier description of baked goods before? When people say "if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen," I'm not sure this is the type of thing they're referring to, but either way I'm curious if the product lives up to it's tantalizing description.

Find out and order yourself (or your sweetie) a batch of <a href="http://www.simplydivinebrownies.com/products.php?f=4">Simply Divine Heavenly Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownies</a>. 

It seems that it would be oddly appropriate to eat these while watching a soap opera or something. So sit back, eat some brownies and have a relaxing and delicious weekend!
