Bananas are annoying.

You might even say that bananas make me - 

- wait for it - 

<em><strong>BANANAS</strong></em>.

Du du CH!

Don't get me wrong, I love em, but if you don't use them on the exact right day for the exact right purpose, things don't go your way. <strong>Exhibit A:</strong> Everyday Food's Peanut-Banana Espresso Smoothie. 

Sounds super yummy, doesn't it? It's got your fruit serving, protein and caffeine hit all in one fowl swoop. Shazam! <em>Kapow!</em> Boom shaka laka!

Well, unfortunately despite all the fun sound effects in my head, it wasn't all that. Perhaps it's because my bananas were one day past smoothie-ready, but the combo of ripe banana and espresso gave this smoothie almost an alcoholic flavor. I didn't think the espresso fit in it at all even though I blended it enough completely to dissolve the powder. It was too dark or bitter or something. Perhaps I should have tried adding a little sugar, but in my half-awake, impatient-for-breakfast state it didn't come to me. And perhaps it was my fault for substituting the regular peanut butter it called for with chocolate peanut butter, but that didn't really fit either. Hmph. The search for the perfect CPB breakfast smoothie continues.

Or maybe instead of searching I'll just play around and try to come up with my own ultimate breakfast smoothie recipe. It's tricky because you want something that's good for you but still flavorful without being too sweet or heavy for the morning. 

Any suggestions?

The recipe for this particular smoothie is after the break incase you want to try it and tell me I did something wrong. Of course, then I'd have to kill you.

(Okay, you knew I was kidding, right? Chocolate and peanut butter is serious stuff but not <em>that</em> serious. :-P )

<strong>Peanut-Banana Espresso Smoothie</strong>
<em>recipe from Everyday Food</em>
Yields 2 lackluster servings

Blend 1 cup <strong>low-fat milk</strong>, 1 tablespoon <strong>instant espresso powder</strong>, 1/4 cup <strong>natural creamy peanut butter</strong>, 1 ripe <strong>banana</strong>( cut into thirds) and 1 cup ice. 

<strong>Note:</strong> I suggest using a banana that's not too far-gone and adding a little sugar to taste.
