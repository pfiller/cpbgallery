I am an adult (or at least my age dictates so) but when I walk in to a store this time of year and see a display of <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/products/details/reesespeanutbuttercups.asp">Reese's Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Eggs</a>, it never fails to make me want to shriek with glee, grab a bag and go running out of the store like a crazy person as I frantically open said bag, tear one of the little wrappers open with my teeth and smash the candy right into my mouth. I then stop suddenly in my tracks and yell "HELL YEAH!" (slightly distored by a mouthful of chocolate and peanut butter) loud enough to echo in the street and make a nearby cluster of birds fly away.

I will never understand why the peanut butter egg tastes better than the peanut butter cup since they're essentially the same thing, but it just does. If you disagree, don't try to argue with me because you're wrong.

While we're on the subject of Reese's, you should check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AG9rRJq6K8">this funny video</a> by Marni, a fellow chocolate-peanut-butter-aholic who writes <a href="http://www.happygomarni.com/">one of my favorite blogs, Happy Go Marni</a>. It's a video made for her job, but I just really got a kick out of the enthusiasm for chocolate & peanut butter, the shout-out to my blog (yay!) and the tip that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/">Talladega Nights</a> is an informative documentary on Nascar, haha.
