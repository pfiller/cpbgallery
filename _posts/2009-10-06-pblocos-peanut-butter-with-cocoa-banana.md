I've already <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/09/24/the-perfect-fall-snack/">raved about P.B.Loco's Peanut Butter with Raspberry White Chocolate</a>, but it's now time to put the spotlight on it's fellow spread, the Cocoa Banana.

Unfortunately I didn't get to do anything fun with this peanut butter like bake cookies with it or drizzle it over ice cream - I was too busy eating it straight out of the jar. I did manage to dip some pretzels in it and try it on a sliced banana and it's delicious both ways. I think the speed at which I went through the jar speaks well for how tasty it was. Though if I had to pick between the two, I might actually go with the Raspberry White Chocolate. However I think that's just due to a personal preference of raspberry over banana; they are both great.

For another snack idea, I also think that this spread would taste great on a graham cracker with some marshmallows. Of course I think just about anything would taste great on a graham cracker. Not anchovies though. Ick - what's wrong with you?

Check out the chocolate and peanut butter swirls on the bottom of the jar. Yum!
