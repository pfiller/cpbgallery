Okay, so... I found a smooth, creamy peanut butter I like that isn't called Jif and Taste Tester ate a PB&J with something other than grape jelly. Hm. Am I in The Twilight Zone?

It all started this past weekend, when I took my first ever trip to a Wegman's. While perusing the peanut butter aisle, I remembered getting a solid recommendation of their peanut butter from <a href="http://www.peanutbutterboy.com/peanut-butter-reviews-part-9/">Peanut Butter Boy</a>. He seems more a fan of the natural, but I picked up a good ol' fashioned jar of <a href="http://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10052&catalogId=10002&productId=387057">the regular stuff</a>. And boy, is it good! It's not necessarily a far cry from Jif (my childhood standby) as far as flavor, but it's amazingly smooth. Like so smooth, it makes Jif's creamy feel coarse. I'm perhaps a bit taken off-guard by how much I like it, but a fan nonetheless!

Prior to swinging by Wegman's in Buffalo, we made a trip to food nerd mecca <a href="http://www.zingermans.com/">Zingerman's</a> in Ann Arbor, Michigan. <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/08/05/visiting-zingermans-in-ann-arbor-michigan/">We had been there once before</a>, but I was just as excited to return for a second visit. Roaming around the store were some very friendly employees giving out sample spoonfuls of <a href="http://farrellfruit.com/flavors/raspberry/">Farrell Fruit's Raspberry Jam</a>. They bragged of it's freshness and they weren't kidding - it tasted like someone had picked the berries and mashed it up minutes before we tasted it. Without hesitation we grabbed a jar to take home. Seeing Taste Tester happily gobble a pb & raspberry instead of his preferred pb & grape was somewhat mind-bending after all these years, but I wasn't complaining!

Deciding to put another Zingerman's purchase to use (and figuring we'd been lucky with the change-ups thus far), I made a pb&j with the <a href="http://www.zingermansbakehouse.com/real-bread/american-breads/">cornbread</a> I bought at their bakeshop instead of using regular bread. Sound strange? Maybe, but raspberry jam is a good pairing for cornbread and since the cornbread was pretty mild, I figured the peanut butter couldn't hurt. It was quite tasty, though a bit more of a sugar rush than your standard pb&j, so it might serve better as a sweet afternoon snack than a lunch.

Cornbread Peanut Butter & Jamâ€¦ consider it a southern-style pb&j, y'all!
