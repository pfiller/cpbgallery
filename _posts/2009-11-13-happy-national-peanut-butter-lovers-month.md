In honor of National Peanut Butter Month, Yelp's <a href="http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=PBEQY22FqpnZpErWay_mmw">New York City Weekly Newsletter</a> was all about peanut butter. I was of course happy to read a newsletter about one of my favorite ingredients, only to find that I was in it! They featured <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-revenge-new-york#hrid:YkobUWnP7n897wzFWHWoHg">a review I had written</a> about one of my favorite nyc cupcakeries, <a href="http://www.sweetrevengenyc.com/">Sweet Revenge</a>:

"For those with a real sweet tooth, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-YldR077YHNelbmw9ZHbnA">Kristy S</a> vouches for Sweet Revenge's namesake cupcakes bursting with “great peanutty flavor stuffed with a dark ganache filling. The peanut butter cake and the icing all at once... mmmm... perfection!”

Whoever writes their newsletter must not be too concerned with grammar because I'm <em>pretty</em> sure that "peanutty" isn't actually a word. However the important thing is that now you know where to get really yummy peanut butter treats all over the city! Check out <a href="http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=PBEQY22FqpnZpErWay_mmw">the newsletter</a> so you know where to find Peanut Butter Jelly Cannoli and an Eel and Peanut Butter Sushi Roll. And no, I didn't make either of those up!
