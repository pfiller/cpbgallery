I just thought this was such a great photo. Her eyes are so big and full of excitement and her hands are holding the cupcake like it's a prize. Doesn't it look like it should just be glowing with almightiness? The big booming voice in my head is saying "SEE THIS CUPCAKE. BOW BEFORE IT'S GLORY!"

Am I letting my imagination get too carried away? Oh fine, I'll stop.

She is holding (and by the looks of it, about to devour) a peanut butter cupcake with chocolate chips topped with a creamy peanut butter frosting and chocolate sprinkles. She found this little treasure at <a href="http://www.sprinklescupcakes.com/index.html">Sprinkles</a> in Palo Alto, CA. I'll just sit and wait for them to open a location on the east coast. 

... anytime now...

Thanks to flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/katieelizabethphotography/">katherine elizabeth</a> for sharing her lovely photo.

If you do live close to one of their 5 (soon to be 6) locations, and have yet to go, head over on a Tuesday or Sunday to pick up a Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake. Check out their fun color-coded <a href="http://www.sprinklescupcakes.com/flavors.html">calendar</a> for the full cupcake schedule.
