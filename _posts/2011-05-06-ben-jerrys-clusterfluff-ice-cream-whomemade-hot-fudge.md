Like any smart chocoholic, I tend to order hot fudge on my ice cream sundaes for maximum chocolatization. Unfortunately it seems that most ice cream places make a sub-par fudge. It's either too sweet, made with low-quality chocolate or has grainy sugar crystals. Bleh. So I decided <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/perfect-hot-fudge-sauce?autonomy_kw=hot%20fudge%20sauce">to whip up a big batch of the stuff</a> myself to keep at home. And I found the perfect ice cream to go with it: <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/flavors/our-flavors/">Ben & Jerry's Clusterfluff</a>.

It's got all of my favorite things! Peanut butter ice cream, caramel clusters, marshmallow swirls and peanut butter swirls. It's like a crunchy fluffernutter sandwich in ice cream form. My usual Ben & Jerry's pick is <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/08/20/feelin-lovey-dovey-with-my-chubby-hubby/">Chubby Hubby</a> which is a saltier peanut butter flavor, but if sweet is more your thing, this one is your jam.

Aside from quality control, another advantage to making ice cream sundaes at home as opposed to going out for them is portion control. Yes, it is a little dangerous having a stash of ice cream in the house, but at least I don't have to witness stifled snickers from the people behind the counter as I sheepishly ask for the kid-size. Hey, adults like small servings, too! At least they don't card me…

In general, I prefer a dark bittersweet fudge, but I think lighter chocolates (semi or milk) would pair nicely with this ice cream as well. Get the recipe <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/perfect-hot-fudge-sauce?autonomy_kw=hot%20fudge%20sauce">here</a>. And get to your local grocery store and pick up a pint of <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/flavors/our-flavors/">Ben & Jerry's Clusterfluff</a>. Because not having ice cream on-hand in the midst of a vicious hunger pang would be a cluster… *ahem*... [rhymes with puck]. 

Enjoy!
