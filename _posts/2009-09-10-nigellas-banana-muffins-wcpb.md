Okay people, it's time: I simply have to profess my love for Nigella Lawson's <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/1401322433">Nigella Express</a>. It's way overdue, but better late than never, right? So let me tell you, I LOVE this book. Taste Tester was kind enough to get it for me for no reason other than to fuel my crazy cookbook addiction. A few days ago, I made Nigella's Totally Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies and today's menu included these yummy banana muffins. 

Not only are these great, but you can whip them up ridiculously fast. The first time around, I made them exactly according to the recipe and they were perfectly moist and tasty, but I felt the flavor needed some small adjustments. The sweet butterscotch chips and lack of salt made for some very sweet muffins (and as you may know, I like my salt!). This time around, I opted to add a little salt and substituted the butterscotch with half milk chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips. The new ingredients were great in these - but then again, I am <em>slightly</em> biased when it comes to chocolate and peanut butter. :P

Nigella's recipe is posted below with slight modifications (as mentioned above), but you need to do yourself and more importantly, your tummy a favor and <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/1401322433">buy her book immediately</a>. Her recipes are so easy to make, even on a weekday after a long day of work. And despite the little preparation that goes into them, somehow they are just as delicious as recipes that keep you in the kitchen all day long. 

FYI, these muffins are moist and therefore freeze well, so if you actually have any leftover (it's unlikely, I realize), then freeze them and enjoy for a homemade breakfast on a nice lazy morning!

Recipe after the break!

<strong>Nigella's Banana Muffins w/CPB</strong>
<em>modified from Nigella Lawson's <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/1401322433">Nigella Express</a>, pg. 262</em>
Yields 12 muffins

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

½ cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 2/3 cup flour
½ cup sugar
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp	baking soda
½ tsp salt
1&#188; cups mashed bananas (about 2½ bananas)
½ cup milk chocolate chips
½ cup peanut butter chips

<strong>Directions</strong>

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a standard muffin tin with muffin cups.

2. Measure the oil into a large glass measuring cup and beat in the eggs.

3. Put flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl and mix in the liquid ingredients, followed by the mashed bananas.

4. Fold in milk and peanut butter chips, then divide equal quantities into the waiting muffin pan – I use an ice cream scoop and a spatula – and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
