*Update: I was just informed that this recipe is originally from <a href="http://www.bakeorbreak.com/">bake or break</a>. Please take a visit over there as they are constantly posting amazing recipes such as these beautiful bundt cakes!*

I really love finding recipes for chocolate cakes and cookies that use actual melted chocolate in the batter instead of just cocoa. Melted chocolate gives it a much fuller flavor that satisfies my intense chocolate cravings. 

A lot of bundt cake recipes instruct you to pour half the batter into the pan, then sprinkle some sort of mixed topping (ie. to make a cinnamon sugar swirl through the middle of the cake), then pour the rest of the batter in. This recipe doesn't have a mixed topping, but instead instructs you to add a layer of peanut butter chips. Yum!

And I don't know about you but I also enjoy finding a recipe that puts my mini-bundt cake pans to use. They seem to sit on the shelf the longest before getting re-used, and for being so pretty, it's really a shame. I have some that are shaped like roses. 

Chocolate peanut butter roses. Mmmmmm.

If you are imperfect like myself and have trouble getting your bundt cakes out of their molds, try this helpful recipe for a baker's version of "<a href="http://angiespangies.com/2008/02/10/55/">WD-40</a>" from the blog <a href="http://angiespangies.com/">Angies Pangies</a>. Don't worry it's nothing scary, just a mixture of canola oil, vegetable shortening and all-purpose flour or cocoa (it says you could use either for chocolate cakes). The memory of my last crumbled bundt cake is still fresh, so I will definitely be trying it!

<div class="recipe">
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
1 stick butter, softened<br>
1 3/4 cups sugar<br>
2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
Pinch salt<br>
2 eggs<br>
4 oz melted unsweetened chocolate<br>
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br>
1 1/4 cups milk<br>
1/2 cup peanut butter chips<br>
1/4 cup cocoa powder<br>
1 cup powdered sugar<br>
2 to 3 Tbsp milk<br>
<br>
<strong>Directions</strong><br>
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and lightly flour (or apply the above WD-40 recipe to) 12 individual (about 1 cup size) bundt tins.<br>
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with a paddle, cream the butter and sugar together.<br>
3. In a small mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt and set aside. Add the eggs, one at a time, to the butter mixture. Mix well after each egg. Add the chocolate and vanilla. Mix well.<br>
4. Add the sifted flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, alternating with the milk. Mix well.<br>
5. Fill each tin 1/2 full with the batter. Place some of the peanut butter chips in the center of the batter. Then pour the remaining batter over the chips.<br>
6. Place in the pre-heated oven and cook for 18 to 20 minutes.<br>
7. Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes in the pan. Invert the cakes onto a wire rack. Let cool completely before adding glaze, so it doesn't run off the cakes.<br>
8. Make the glaze: In a small mixing bowl, combine the cocoa powder, powdered sugar and milk. Mix until smooth. Spoon some of the glaze over each bundt cake. Allow the glaze to set, then serve.
