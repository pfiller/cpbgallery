My commute for work is a bit further than normal this week, so with no time to cook, I am all about quick ways to get my chocolate peanut butter fix. I noticed this lovely photo by flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/helloinfinite/">mae jane</a> and decided it was a good source of inspiration for anyone out there that thinks it takes a lot of work to acquire a homemade treat. 

I don't think "homemade" should necessarily mean that something takes a ton of work or a few hours of prep, but it seems that's what most people think. For me, eating something homemade can even mean eating something that's not completely manufactured tasting - (manufactured tasting = something straight from a box or wrapper). So even if you're busy like me this week, try to take even just a few minutes and whip yourself up something quick and yummy... like some bread with a healthy slathering of nutella and peanut butter. 

See <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/03/22/chocolate-and-peanut-butter-on-a-spoon/">this previous post</a> for other quick ways to satisfy your chocolate and peanut butter cravings.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/helloinfinite/">mae jane</a> for sharing her photo.
