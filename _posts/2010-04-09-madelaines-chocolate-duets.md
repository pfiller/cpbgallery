There's a reason that I decided to write a blog about two flavors instead of just one: I like desserts with different layers and textures. Layers make each bite exciting and a little different. <a href="http://www.duetsny.com/">Madelaine's new Duets chocolates</a> are truffles with two different flavored fillings sandwiched together, creating a fun mixed flavor sensation. Given my love of multi-layered treats it's no surprise that I enjoyed these!

I've probably proclaimed myself a 'dark chocolate girl' quite a few times on this site, but that's because I find that most milk chocolate is too sugary. However, Madelaine's milk chocolate is more creamy than sugary, and we liked it a whole lot. Also, the day we tried them, it got really warm outside and consequently in my apartment, so the chocolate was at that balmy temperature where you touch it with you finger and leave a light print. It made the milk chocolate taste a little extra creamy and the fillings a little extra soft. Perfection!

Madelaine's Duets come in four flavor combinations: Peanut Butter & Caramel, Raspberry & Peanut Butter, Milk Truffle & White Truffle, Raspberry & White Truffle. Read on to find out which one we liked the best!

<strong>Peanut Butter & Caramel</strong>

Taste Tester liked this one a lot - some audible "mmming" even ensued while he was eating it. Caramel and peanut butter is one of his favorite combinations and he especially liked that this truffle had a nice hint of salt. I thought it was good but actually preferred the contrast of the salty peanut butter and sweet raspberry (see below) better than the salty peanut butter and smooth buttery caramel.

<strong>Raspberry & Peanut Butter</strong>

Taste Tester and I both loved the peanut butter filling. It's super creamy, not too sweet and a bit salty. The raspberry was fairly gelatinous (a la chocolate-covered jelly rings) and was probably the only filling that I wasn't super crazy about. The texture was just a bit too unnatural-tasting for me, but if you eat the whole thing at once, the heavier textures of the peanut butter and milk chocolate hide the raspberry's texture well, giving you that nice punch of raspberry flavor without the gel feel. Textures aside, the contrast of the bright raspberry and salty peanut butter was tasty.

<strong>Milk Truffle & White Truffle</strong>

You get the best of both chocolate worlds here - light and dark. Like milk chocolate, white chocolate also tends to be too sweet, but theirs has just the right amount of sweetness with that luscious milky feel. 

This was the surprise underdog of the Duets collection. I never would have guessed that Taste Tester would have even tried let alone loved anything white chocolate (very uncharacteristic of him) and while I like white chocolate, never thought I would love it either. This was sooo creamy and definitely my favorite of all the Duets.

<strong>Raspberry & White Truffle</strong>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kstar810/4494249574/in/set-72157603817944040"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4494249574_8c8e96c3ed.jpg" alt="Raspberry & White Truffle" /></a>

Again, not super sold on the raspberry but really liked the creamy milk & white chocolates together. Definitely a worthy contender but not quite as awesome as its delectable competition.

To conclude, we enjoyed all of the Duets but the Milk Truffle & White Truffle was my fave and the Peanut Butter & Caramel was Taste Tester's (with the Milk Truffle & White Truffle as a close runner-up). Try them all and decide for yourself! They go on sale April 12th but you can pre-order them now on <a href="http://www.duetsny.com/">the Duets website</a>.
