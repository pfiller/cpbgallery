This is sort of a continuation of a previous post. I tried an experiment a bit ago and created a recipe for <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/08/chocolate-tortilla-chips-peanut-butter-bean-dip/">Peanut Butter Bean Dip</a> to be served with Chocolate Tortilla Chips by <a href="http://www.foodshouldtastegood.com/portfolio_chocolate.asp">Food Should Taste Good</a>. Unfortunately the name lied and they didn't taste good. The Peanut Butter Bean Dip was yummy, but after rejecting the chocolate tortilla chips, I proceeded to eat them with just your standard Tostito. 

However, recently I discovered <a href="http://www.vosgeschocolate.com/product/red_fire_tortillas/crunchy_snacks">Vosges Red Fire Chocolate-Covered Tortilla Chips</a>. And considering I have yet to taste something by Vosges that I don't like, let alone that I don't completely freak out over due to overwhelming deliciousness, I can't wait to pick up some of these. I should also mention that <a href="http://www.vosgeschocolate.com/product/red_fire_exotic_candy_bar/exotic_candy_bars">The Red Fire Bar</a> might be my favorite of the Vosges Bars. <em>Might </em>be. It's certainly not an easy decision to make.

Maybe using these as a scoop for the dip would be good, maybe it wouldn't... either way, I'm dying to try these!
