Thanks for all the kind words following <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/02/25/a-blogiversary-gift/">the Blogiversary post</a>! I always enjoy reading your comments and hope that you continue to enjoy the site. :) I've got something really unique and delicious for you today... they may not be the prettiest breakfast treat you've ever seen, but hear me out:

As I've mentioned many times, my kitchen is very small, and this being the case, I often feel guilty when there's a pan cluttering it up that hadn't been used in a while. Unfortunately, my <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/c332/index.cfm?pkey=xsrd0m1%7C16%7C%7C%7C0%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7Cebelskiver&cm%5Fsrc=SCH">Ebelskiver pan</a> had fallen into this category. I absolutely love it though and refused to get rid of it. Taste Tester had never had ebelskivers before and I think after this experience, he understood why I love them so.

Just imagine starting your day by biting into a moist spherical pancake, fresh off the pan as it's warm peanut butter filling oozes out onto your tongue. The moist and slightly salty batter mingles with the peanut butter and you realize that getting out of bed - even though it's your day off - was a great decision.

Aside from not having used the pan in a while, I was also looking for a way to use up a container of ricotta cheese in my fridge. Ricotta may seem like an odd addition to pancake batter, but trust me on this, it adds such nice texture.

Ebelskivers make a really great addition to any brunch menu, since most people (at least the ones that I know) have never tasted  or even heard of them. These can be made with a variety of fillings so that all of your guests are happy and well fed. You'll notice that this recipe is for PB&J filling, not C&PB (gasp!) but fear not, you can repurpose the same recipe with the addition of some chocolate. I once made the same batter filled with sliced banana, peanut butter and nutella and they were delicious! Try thinking up your own flavor combinations and have fun tasting your edible experiments.

If you plan to make them, head to Williams Sonoma first and get your very own odd-shaped <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/c332/index.cfm?pkey=xsrd0m1%7C16%7C%7C%7C0%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7Cebelskiver&cm%5Fsrc=SCH">Ebelskiver pan</a>. 

Happy Breakfast! :)

<strong>Peanut Butter and Jelly Ebelskivers</strong><br>
(modified from <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/recipedetail.cfm?objectid=4FEB2082%2DE0C9%2DE1B0%2D8C390A4C6C211224">Williams-Sonoma</a>)<br>
<br>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour<br>
¾ teaspoons baking soda<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1 ½ tablespoons granulated sugar<br>
½ teaspoon salt<br>
3 egg yolks<br>
1 ½ cups buttermilk<br>
¾ cup ricotta cheese<br>
5 egg whites<br>
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted<br>
Confectioners' sugar for garnish<br>
Peanut butter (I used Jif)<br>
Grape jelly<br>
<br>
<strong>Directions</strong><br>
<br>
1. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, granulated sugar and salt. In another bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks. Whisk in the buttermilk and ricotta. Whisk the egg yolk mixture into the flour mixture until well combined; the batter will be lumpy. Set aside. <br>
<br>
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff but not dry peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir the whites into the batter in two additions. <br>
<br>
3. Put 1/4 tsp. butter in each well of a filled-pancake pan. Place over medium heat and heat until the butter begins to bubble. Pour 1 Tbs. batter into each well. Place 1/4-1/2 tsp each of peanut butter and jelly in the center of the batter and top with 1 Tbs. batter. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Using 2 spoons, flip the pancakes over and cook until golden and crispy, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter. <br>
<br>
4. Dust the pancakes with confectioners' sugar just before serving. Serve warm. Makes about 30.
