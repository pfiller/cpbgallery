These are Chocolate Chunk Cookies from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Martha-Stewarts-Baking-Handbook-Stewart/dp/0307236722/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1203086749&amp;sr=1-1" title="Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook" target="_blank">Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook</a>. If you don't have this book yet, you should grab a copy. Right now. Go ahead, this blog isn't going anywhere. I've tried an innumerable amount of recipes from it and it is the clear favorite of my baking books. 

This recipe is great as it was in the book, but I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet and substituted 1/3 of the chocolate chunks with peanut butter chips. They are crispy on the edges, soft in the middle, just the right touch salty and completely packed with chocolate and peanut butter morsels.

Chocolate Chunk PB Cookies<br>
Recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Martha-Stewarts-Baking-Handbook-Stewart/dp/0307236722/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203301712&sr=8-1">Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook</a><br>
<br>
Makes about 3 dozen<br>
<br>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature<br>
1 cup granulated sugar<br>
1/2 cup packed dark-brown sugar<br>
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>
1 large whole egg, plus 1 large egg white<br>
9 oz bittersweet chocolate chunks<br>
4 oz peanut butter chips<br>
<br>
<strong>Directions</strong><br>
Preheat the oven to 375&#176;, with racks in the supper and lower thirds. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and both sugars on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br>
<br>
Add the vanilla, whole egg, and egg white. Beat on low speed until well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 1 minute. Add flour mixture in two batches, mix until just combined. Mix in chocolate and peanut butter chips.<br>
<br>
Shape 2 heaping tablespoons of dough at a time into balls and place about 1 1/2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake, rotating sheets halfway through, until cookies are golden brown, about 18 minutes. Transfer parchment and cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.<br>
<br>
I tend to like cookies a bit soft in the middle. If you take these out when they are lightly browned on the edges but look uncooked in the centers, they are perfect. They keep in a tin forever, so if 3 dozen sounds like a lot, it's not. They WILL get eaten.
