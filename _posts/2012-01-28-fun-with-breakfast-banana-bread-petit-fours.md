The Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Bread Gallery was just too long a name, but make no mistake - we <em>love</em> banana bread. I make it a lot but as delicious as it is, even I get a little tired with the same old presentation: brick of bread on a plate.

Lately I've been making fancier breakfasts than usual, so brick on a plate doesn't quite hold up to my standards. Unless you have enough bricks to build some kind of fort. That'd be cool.

What? I didn't say I had <em>mature</em> standards.

Without enough bricks to build a fort (drat), I did the next best thing and covered the bread I had left in peanut butter frosting and chocolate hazelnut frosting.

These are easy to make, they look fancy and you can eat em with your hands. They are great for kids to assemble and eat as well, especially if you cover em in rainbow sprinkles. It is the weekend after all, so have a little fun with your food. Go bananas!

The peanut butter and chocolate hazelnut spreads I had were too thick to spread on the banana bread without making a mess of them, so I thinned em out a little to make a frosting. They are sweeter and better this way anyway. :-) Enjoy!

<strong>Banana Bread Petit Fours</strong>  
Yields 2 servings

1/3 loaf of your favorite banana bread, cut into large cubes  
1-2 bananas, sliced 1/2 inch thick, at an angle

<strong>To make the peanut butter frosting, whisk together:</strong>  
2 Tbsp natural roasted peanut butter (I used <a href="http://justinsnutbutter.com/">Justin's</a>)  
1 Tbsp 2% or soymilk  
1 Tbsp + 1 tsp honey  
generous sprinkle of cinnamon

<strong>To make the chocolate hazelnut frosting whisk together:</strong>  
2 Tbsp <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/p-107-hey-hey-hazelnut-chocolate-hazelnut-spread.aspx">Askinosie   Chocolate Hazelnut Spread</a>*  
2 Tbsp 2% or soymilk  
1 Tbsp light brown sugar  
sprinkle cinnamon  
<em>*If using Nutella, omit the sugar and use less milk. The Askinosie Spread is far superior though, so I recommend you pick up a jar!</em>

<strong>To assemble:</strong>  
Coat one side of each banana bread cube in the frosting of your choice and top with a slice of banana bread. Serve immediately- in a fort, if possible. :-P
