I know that I<a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/03/20/vosges-peanut-butter-bonbons/">'ve mentioned before</a> how much I love salt, but incase you missed it, here it is again:

I LOVE salt.

The combination of sweet and salty never gets old for me. <a href="http://www.lesserevil.com/">Lesser Evil</a> sells many delicious kettle corn flavors, but the one that caught my eye was, of course, their <a href="http://www.lesserevil.com/kettlecorns.html">Peanut Butter Choco</a> flavor. They say "kernels with a dark cocoa coating intermingling with creamy natural peanut butter coated popcorn is a beautiful thing." Anyone out there care to disagree? Yeah, I didn't think so.

I'm such a sucker for packaging. I like their product without even tasting it. And apparently I'm not the only one. <a href="http://www.notcot.com/archives/2006/03/lesser_evil.php">NOTCOT</a> also took note of their fun pattern and festive packaging noting, "best of all is really this pattern of graphics they designed which is on the foil/plastic wrap in the box, as well as a desktop wallpaper available on the site." 

Grab yourself a beautiful box of Lesser Evil's Kettle Corn (to taste, if not just to look at) at your local Whole Foods or place an order on <a href="http://www.lesserevil.com/kettlecorns.html">their website</a>. It looks like the smallest amount you can buy on their site is a 4-pack, but one box wouldn't really enough anyway, now would it?
