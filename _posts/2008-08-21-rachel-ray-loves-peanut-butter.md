I picked up Rachel Ray's <a href="http://www.rachaelraymag.com/">Everyday Mag</a> this month and was pleasantly surprised to find that peanut butter was mentioned at least a few times in the issue. It even included a recipe for these super tasty looking <a href="http://www.rachaelraymag.com/recipes/dessert-recipes/chocolate-peanut-butter-fudge-crunch/article.html">Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge Crunch Bars</a>!

This recipe came with the quote, "I could happily live on chocolate and peanut butter alone - no kidding! For this easy fudge recipe, I mix these two flavors with some crispy rice cereal, and in one bite, you get smooth and buttery with just enough crunch. That's really all I could ever ask for in a dessert." Me too!

The magazine also includes a list of the best peanut butters including the best smooth, honey, crunchy, natural creamy, natural crunchy, and my favorite category: best oddball. They awarded the prestigious best oddball award to <a href="http://www.pbloco.com/Expand.asp?ProductCode=PB-RWC">P.B.Loco's Raspberry White Chocolate Peanut Butter</a> noting it as sweet and tangy like a fresh raspberry tart.

The magazine also noted peanut butter to be a favorite pantry item in their Food A to Z article. Well, of course it's a favorite! No offense, but way to state the obvious, Rach!
