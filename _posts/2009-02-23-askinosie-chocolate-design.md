Before I get into this whole great big post, I just wanted to announce that The Chocolate Peanut Butter Gallery just had it's one year blogiversary! Yay! It's been a whole year of chocolate peanut butter and I can't believe how fast it went! I've learned a lot about CPB and met a ton of wonderful chocolate peanut butter lovers along the way. A big thanks to all of you who have stuck with me and apologies for any weight gained in the process. It was worth it though, wasn't it? :)

Thanks to the blog, over the last year I've come in contact with some of my favorite chocolate and peanut butter brands, one of which is <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/">Askinosie Chocolate</a>. As if designing their <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/07/02/fancy-food-show-part-i-askinosie-chocolate/">Itty Bar Jar</a> wasn't cool enough, they also let me take a crack at their <a href="https://www.askinosie.com/p-71-aski-noshie-bar-50g.aspx">Noshie Bar</a>, <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/p-64-single-origin-natural-cocoa-powder-soconusco-mexico.aspx">Cocoa Powder</a> and <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/c-2-cocoa-nibs.aspx">Cocoa Nibs</a> tubes.

Here's the Cocoa Powder:

And here are the Cocoa Nibs:

I was so happy to stumble upon the newly designed cocoa powder at <a href="http://brooklyn.greenegrape.com/">The Greene Grape</a> in Brooklyn. It's nice to see that it's getting out there because it is a truly awesome product that should be in every baker's pantry.

I posted more photos of the packaging on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kstar810/sets/72157610729727753/">flickr</a>. Do your future desserts a favor and get yourself some Askinosie <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/p-64-single-origin-natural-cocoa-powder-soconusco-mexico.aspx">Cocoa Powder</a> and <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/c-2-cocoa-nibs.aspx">Nibs</a>. It felt really great to design for products I believe in. All of the aforementioned products are truly top notch and highly recommended.

When I started to write this post I realized that I never posted the pics of the <a href="https://www.askinosie.com/p-71-aski-noshie-bar-50g.aspx">Noshie Bar</a>! How'd that happen? Not only did Askinosie let me design the packaging for their chocolate products, but they let me design right on the chocolate! This design was silkscreened in cocoa butter on their very addictive Noshie Bar:

In their words, "the Aski-noshie Bar is our candy bar heaven. We make the bar with crunchy roasted cocoa nib shortbread as the base. Then we top it with our homemade caramel that is made with a touch of fleur de sel sea salt. To finish it off, we enrobe it in our single origin dark chocolate. Nosh is the Yiddish word for "snack" and it is perfect for just that."

All of the elements of this bar mesh really well together and the sprinkle of kosher salt is the perfect finishing touch.

Just imagine your teeth sinking into that thick layer of caramel. Mmm. And that shortbread with the nibs! My heart be still...

BTW if you make it to <a href="http://brooklyn.greenegrape.com/">The Greene Grape</a> you can pick up lots of delicious chocolate (like Askinosie) and tasty peanut butters by <a href="http://www.pbloco.com/">P.B. Loco</a>. I picked up a jar for my sister and it was hard to pass up the <a href="http://www.pbloco.com/Expand.asp?ProductCode=PB-CCB">Peanut Butter with CoCoBanana</a>, but I ended up taking home the <a href="http://www.pbloco.com/Expand.asp?ProductCode=PB-CCCD">Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough</a> instead.

Have I covered enough tasty treats for one post? Enjoy!
