Just looking at this Peanut Butter and Chocolate Sprinkles Sandwich makes me feel like a little kid again, so I can only imagine how it would feel if I actually went and ate it.

This sandwich might not be super healthy, might not keep you full all day, might make your mom sigh if she saw it, but sometimes it's fun to be a little irresponsible. Besides, you can be health-conscious and eat your vegetables tomorrow. Mondays are tough because the next relaxing weekend feels like a long stretch away, but if you take a day to bring a kid's lunch to work and it might just make those five days a little more fun and go by a little bit faster. 

But if you <em>really</em> need to make it a <em>little</em> healthier, I think it would be tasty with some sliced strawberries!
