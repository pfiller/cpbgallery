Ah, holiday baking. Despite being sick with a bad cold and tired from all the running around, I never cease to enjoy it. In between showings of <em>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</em>, <em>Elf</em> and <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> I baked up 150 cookies to share with family, friends and neighbors. This years treats are:

& <a href="http://www.culinaryconcoctionsbypeabody.com/2010/12/07/white-chocolate-topped-gingerbread-cookies/">Peabody's White Chocolate Gingerbread Cookies</a>

I'd like to give you a favorite, but these were all winners. I think the Midnight Espresso Cookies possibly garnered the most raves. The Malted Vanilla Cookies marked my first experience with using real vanilla bean and I thoroughly enjoyed the results - if you're a fan of butter cookies, I strongly recommend them. The Gingerbread Cookie recipe came from Peabody's blog, which never lets me down - they were nicely spiced and very tasty. 

And well, who doesn't love a classic Peanut Butter Blossom on Christmas?

Hope you enjoy your holiday sweets and of course the time spent with your loved ones. From us here in Chocolate Peanut Butter land, Happy Holidays!! :)
