Not the most photogenic treat, but don't be fooled, this stuff is addictive.

Side Note: I think I'm going to mix it up a little and post items from the food show every couple days instead of every single day. This way you can still come here for recipe ideas and I can blab about what's being made in my kitchen because, well... I never stop baking.

For the sake of argument, I'm calling this creation Puppy Chow, but it is also known as People Chow, People Puppy Chow, Muddy Buddies and who knows what else. It almost feels silly to include a recipe for this since it's so easy to change and throw in whatever you have in your pantry, but this is the version I made. It was made for a BBQ and very well received. I'm not sure if that proves how good it is since it was consumed by a bunch of 20-somethings and they eat anything, but it did garner a lot of compliments and I thought it was really good.

This is another great treat to make on a hot day if you don't feel like sitting in the kitchen. Can you tell that this is the going trend with the recipes I've been posting lately?

Also, I was a little disenchanted after I added the powdered sugar and rather than having that snowy powdered coating, it kind of got soaked into the chocolate. I'm not sure if I should have waited to add it until the chocolate cooled a bit, but this actually made for cleaner handling. 

Enjoy and stay cool! Recipe after the break.

<strong>Chocolate Peanut Butter Puppy Chow</strong>
Based on a recipe from <a href="http://www.chex.com/Recipes/RecipeView.aspx?RecipeId=19919&CategoryId=342">Chex</a>

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
7 cups Chex cereal
2 cups golden grahams
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup butter
1 tsp vanilla
1/8 tsp fine salt
1-1/2 cups powdered sugar
1/3 cup <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kstar810/2382067358/">Butterfinger Marble Mix-Ins</a>*
1/8 cup butterscotch chips, chopped
1/8 cup peanut butter chips, chopped

<strong>Directions</strong>
1. Combine cereals in a large bowl. 
2. Melt chocolate chips, peanut butter and butter over low heat, stirring until melted. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and salt.
3. Pour the chocolate mixture over the cereal, stirring gently with a plastic spoon until coated.
4. Measure the powdered sugar into a large plastic zip bag (or a bowl if you don't have a bag that's big enough). Then add the chocolate mixture, Butterfinger Marble Mix-Ins*, butterscotch chips and peanut butter chips into the bag and shake (or invite your kid into the kitchen to shake it up for you).

* If you can't find this, chopped butterfinger bars would work great too.
