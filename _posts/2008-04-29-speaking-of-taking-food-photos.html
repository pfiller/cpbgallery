...Here's me taking one of a slice at Patsy's Pizza in NYC:

And here's the picture of pizza I am taking in the above article:

This popped up in <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/index.html">The Daily News</a> yesterday. As I mentioned, I went on <a href="http://www.scottspizzatours.com/">Scott's Pizza Tour</a>. It was the first official run of the tour and The Daily News came along to snap pictures, get some pizza insight and chow down with us. It's a pretty silly pic, but I spend a lot of my time taking food photos these days, so I suppose it's appropriate! Seems that Scott should have gotten the larger page real estate, but you can see him and read the article <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/04/28/2008-04-28_pizza_tour_leads_cheeseandsauce_faithful.html">here</a> if you're interested.

It was a good practice in taking photos with the new camera (not pictured - the above shot is of my Canon Powershot). Though the adventure was off to a rough start because I dropped my nice new flash on the sidewalk as I was taking it out of the bag. *Crash!* Luckily, it got a little dinged up but didn't come away with any functional damage. Whew!

Sorry to get a little off topic today, but I've been talking a bit about food photography lately so it fits... kinda sorta... ha. I also took photos of candy bars I will be reviewing soon, so you can take a look at this in the meantime... It's the inside of the crazy looking Sky Bar that I had purchased after the tour. You can see the four pockets of various fillings including (from left to right) the fudge, caramel, vanilla nougat and peanut butter. Review coming soon!
