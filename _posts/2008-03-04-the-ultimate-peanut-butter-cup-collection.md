I can think of at least three brands of peanut butter cups off the top of my head. There's the obvious, Reeses PB Cup, then the Newman's Own PB Cup and these bad boys. It's a set of 12 that includes white chocolate, milk chocolate, dark chocolate and an "inside out" cup. I came across them during my last visit to <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter & Co</a>. and though they look delicious, I stood staring at them, wishing they also sold smaller packages of them. I wanted one right then and there, but didn't feel up to the task of lugging a whole box of them around with the peanut butter I was buying. I guess I could have bought the box and eaten all of them right there in a one man all-you-can-eat contest starring me. 

Unfortunately the thought didn't come to me until after the fact and I walked out with no peanut butter cups in hand. *Sigh* Getting home and reading Candy Addict's review of these little delights sure made me regret my decision.
