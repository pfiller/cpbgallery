Three posts in a row. Woohoo!

I just discovered a really sweet comment on <a href="http://cupcakestakethecake.blogspot.com/2008/12/guest-blogger-kristina-from-chocolate.html">my guest post at Cupcakes Take The Cake</a>. Pauline of the blog <a href="http://springchook.blogspot.com/2008/12/cupcake-party.html">Cafe Gorgeous</a> used my cupcake hats pattern to make these awesome cupcakes with a group of kids! 

Of the cupcakes she says, "What did they taste like? Who cares! They had hats on!" Haha, I love it. Thanks Pauline, this made my day!

Read the full post and get the printable hat patterns at <a href="http://cupcakestakethecake.blogspot.com/2008/12/guest-blogger-kristina-from-chocolate.html">Cupcakes Take The Cake</a>. Below is what the plain pattern looks like, just waiting for your personal touch!

If anyone else out there used the pattern, feel free to send me a pic. I'd love to see what you did with it! :)
