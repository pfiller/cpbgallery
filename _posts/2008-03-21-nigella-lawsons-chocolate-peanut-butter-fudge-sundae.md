The above is not a direct quote from Nigella, but is it just me or does hearing her slowly describe her recipes in her English accent make them sound more tempting? You disagree? Okay, re-read the above in boring American speak and tell me it has the same effect. Yeah, I thought so.

Sometimes when the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/">Food Network</a> gets a new chef, it takes me a while to warm up to them. It might be that they are sickeningly bubbly or that their recipes are too complicated. But I almost instantly embraced <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_nl/article/0,3100,FOOD_27597_4992624,00.html">Nigella Lawson</a>. She's got a quirky, likeable and honest personality and when she says that something is easy or quick to make, it really is easy and quick. A lot of recipes on Food Network and in general, that are so called "quick" involve having your ingredients pre-washed, pre-measured or pre-chopped. However, hers tend to be true to their descriptions and come together quickly, not to mention they are quite tasty.

This recipe is from an episode she did on foods you can make from your pantry. When I watched her make this on TV she used:

Just under 1/2 can (200 ml of cond milk)
100 g dark chocolate chips (no chopping involved!)
100 g smooth peanut butter

She thinned it out with a bit of water while she was stirring because she said it would thicken up later and this way it would be easier to pour. I'm not sure why the printed recipe posted on Food Network is so different than the one she made on TV, but I can vouch for the tv version because it just looked so rich and delicious. However, I am including the printed instructions as well so you can choose.

Mmmm... chocolate peanut butter fudge over toffee ice cream... Blimey, it looks good!

The printed version of this recipe is after the break. See a video of Nigella make the tv version <a href="http://video.aol.com/video-detail/nigella-lawsonchocolate-peanut-butter-fudge-sundae/1450707015">here</a>.
