The caped crusader is officially on the loose - in a store near you!

It has been far too long, my peanut butter-loving friends, but I am so excited to be back to share this amazing new product with you. My friend <a href="http://www.peanutbutterboy.com/">Nick</a> recently launched his very own line of natural peanut butters called <a href="http://store.peanutbutterboy.com/">Peanut Butter Boy</a>. Like myself, he's been enthusiastically writing about peanut butter for a few years so if it's anyone you can trust your prized PB&J in the hands of, it's him.

What makes his peanut butter so super, you ask? In his words, it's:

<blockquote>• Super-natural, low stir and gluten free.
• Made with no added sugar.
• Made with natural sea salt.
• Made with only "unblanched peanuts" which means that he doesn't take off the peanut skins during manufacturing. This yields a peanut butter that has more flavor and nutrients - including more fiber, antioxidants and resveratrol. It also means that the peanut butter is less processed and more natural.</blockquote>

Basically, Nick's peanut butter is quite possibly the closest you can get to freshly ground peanut butter without actually having to farm peanuts and grind em yourself. It has such a natural peanut flavor and both varieties have amazing texture. If you scoop out a spoonful of <a href="http://store.peanutbutterboy.com/products/crunch-power">Crunch Power</a>, you might even find peanut halves! Both varieties are a little salty, which counter-balances sweet jellies for truly the best PB&Js.

Become a believer and try it yourself. As far as I know, he doesn't yet have a "bat signal" type thing, but til he does you can order <a href="http://store.peanutbutterboy.com/">online</a>. Once you do, you can try out some of the yummy recipes on his <a href="http://www.peanutbutterboy.com/">blog</a>. Two of my personal favorites are his awesome <a href="http://www.peanutbutterboy.com/asian-peanut-sauce-dressing/">Thai Peanut Salad Dressing</a> and his sweet but satisfying <a href="http://www.peanutbutterboy.com/gluten-free-peanut-butter-granola-bars/">Gluten Free Peanut Butter Granola Bars</a>.

(Minor self promo: I designed the the PB Boy logo, label and <a href="http://store.peanutbutterboy.com/">website</a>. Have I mentioned I'm excited about this brand?!)
