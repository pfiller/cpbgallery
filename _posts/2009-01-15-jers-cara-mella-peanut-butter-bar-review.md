I found out about <a href="http://www.jers.com/">Jer's</a> at the Fancy Food Show in NYC last June. As someone who writes a blog focused only on chocolate and peanut butter it was shocking to find that somehow I hadn't known about the company that only produces products made with chocolate and peanut butter. How did this happen? Clearly I was asleep at the wheel. The blogging... wheel?... (nevermind, you get it).

The other day I was browsing the chocolate bar shelf in <a href="http://www.edengourmet.com/">Garden of Eden</a> and noticed a collection of Jer's bars. I picked up the <a href="http://www.jers.com/product/65/19">Cara Mella</a> bar and brought it home for Taste Tester and I to assess. I have tasted many a chocolate peanut butter bar at this point and have come to approach new finds with a little more skepticism than optimism.

That said, I really really enjoyed this bar. The chocolate is dark and rich and complements the peanut butter nicely. It seems rare that dark chocolate and peanut butter come together so well. I tend to feel that milk is a better match for pb, but Jer proved me wrong with this bar. The thick layer of caramel is also a stellar component. The box comes with two individually wrapped bars. The bars are a decent size, but two quickly proved not to be enough as I ended up back to the store the next day and grabbed another Cara Mella bar and a <a href="http://www.jers.com/product/63/19">Pretzo Change-o</a> bar (milk chocolate + peanut butter + pretzels). I will be sure to write about that one soon.

The Garden of Eden location that I found these at is on my way home from work. I dare say that it's dangerous for me to be in such close proximity of this bar. I can only hope that they re-stock often!
