I owe The Cheesecake Factory a big thank you. 

I was never a fan of cream cheese and therefore disliked cheesecakes. I'm not sure why, it was just one of those things I never ate growing up and continued to avoid as I got older. But while dining out with a friend at The Cheesecake Factory a few years ago, he pushed me to give theirs a try. And while I didn't like cheesecake at the time, I am never one to turn down dessert. I believe it was the <a href="http://shop.thecheesecakefactory.com/PublicStore/product/Chocolate-Tuxedo-Cream-Cheesecake,159,92.aspx">Chocolate Tuxedo Cream</a> that we ordered, which is layers of fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, vanilla mascarpone mousse and chocolate. It wasn't 100% cheesecake (due to the mascarpone and fudge cake layers) which I think helped wean me onto the whole concept. I was pretty instantly in love. 

I guess I owe my friend a big thank you as well for expanding my horizons, because it feels so good when your tastebuds discover a new food they love.

The Cheesecake Factory offers two chocolate peanut butter varieties for your tastebuds to fall in love with:

<strong>Choice #1:</strong> <a href="http://shop.thecheesecakefactory.com/PublicStore/product/Adams-Peanut-Butter-Cup-Fudge-Ripple-Cheesecake,157,92.aspx">Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake</a>
Our Original Cheesecake, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups®, and Butterfinger® candies together. Baked in a Chocolate Crust and topped with even more Reese’s and Butterfinger and finished with Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Rosettes.

<strong>Choice #2</strong>: <a href="http://shop.thecheesecakefactory.com/PublicStore/product/White-Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Truffle-Cheesecake,175,92.aspx">White Chocolate Peanut Butter Truffle™ Cheesecake</a>
A White Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheesecake Swirled with Roasted Peanut Butter, White Chocolate Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups® and Nutter Butter Cookies® all on top of a Peanut Butter Crumb Crust.

So if you have a friend that just doesn't understand the amazing world of cheesecake, don't shun them. Reach out to them with a trip to <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/">The Cheesecake Factory</a>. You are helping make the world a better place, one appetite at a time. If you can't get to a Cheesecake Factory location, you can also <a href="http://shop.thecheesecakefactory.com/PublicStore/catalog/Cheesecakes,92.aspx">order a cheesecake online</a>. Some of their flavors come in both 10 and 7 inch sizes, but who wouldn't spring for the 10 inch? A crazy person, that's who!
