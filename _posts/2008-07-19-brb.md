Sad to say but it's time for me to take a short little hiatus here at the Chocolate Peanut Butter Gallery. I will be away for a week and a half enjoying the sun somewhere in Michigan. I'm only bothering to write this by chance that I don't have internet where I'm staying. If I do, I'll be back to post here and there, if not, I'll be back after my trip. Feel free to check in while I'm gone. I will be stopping at <a href="http://www.zingermans.com/">Zingerman's</a>, a super cool gourmet shop in Ann Arbor Michigan on the way and I'm sure I'll be reporting on that at some point.

Enjoy the break and stay tuned - I'll be back with more chocolate peanut butter fun before you know it! :)
