I glanced at the January 2009 issue of <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/">Bon Appetit Magazine</a> and instantly noticed the callout right on the cover for a feature on Peanut Butter Desserts. They wrote an article just for us! How nice!

If you didn't manage to get your mitts on an issue, they also have the recipes posted on their website. Check out the <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/magazine/2009/01/peanut_butter_desserts">full feature</a> which includes such awesome CPB recipes as:

&#8226; <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/magazine/2009/01/peanut_butter_and_chocolate_cheesecake_swirl_brownies">Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cheesecake Swirl Brownies</a>
