I've had this recipe for Barefoot Contessa's Banana Pancakes bookmarked for a while with the note, "Holy crap these look good."

This may sound crazy to those of you who can easily whip up the perfect stack of pancakes, but for years I tried and failed to make a thick and fluffy batch. I tried lots of different recipes and different pans to no avail. Our weekend mornings would turn into piles of thin pancakes that were cooked on the outside and wet in the middle. I'd be left sitting frustrated with a mess of dishes to clean up while Taste Tester would politely eat up my lame pancakes and try to convince me that they were delicious.

After doing some research I finally figured out how to make fully cooked, fluffy pancakes (we're talking 1/2 inch thick!). If you're in the same boat as I was (or even if you're not and just want to make damn good pancakes) this may help:

<strong>Super Tips For Making Super-Fluffy Pancakes</strong>
- Whisk the wet mixture vigorously so that your beatened eggs help make the pancakes fluffy.
- Once your wet mixture has been added to your dry, do not over-mix. Lumps make for fluffy pancakes.
- Fry up the pancakes in a stainless pan in vegetable oil or clarified butter. You may think I'm crazy for this one but I had tried a few different non-stick pans and even a griddle. I'd add butter and wipe it away with a paper towel as many recipes instruct you to do, with the same result every time: toasted pancakes with undercooked interiors. Vegetable oil may be a bit higher in calories than you'd prefer but if flavor and texture are your priority, give it a shot. They will be super fluffy with crispy edges! Use just enough to coat the pan to prevent sticking.
- I've never tried this tip before but, I've read that swapping beer for half he liquid in pancake batter makes them extra-fluffy, with a rich, yeasty aroma. 
- Only use recipes that yield a thick batter. I've come across quite a few recipes now that result in a really thin sad-looking batter. Stay away - the thicker batters cook up much more evenly. Like the recipe below, for example...

Using the tips above (all but the beer one), I prepared Barefoot Contessa's recipe for Banana Pancakes and topped them with <a href="http://www.yopeanut.com/our-products/index.asp">Saratoga's New York Maple Peanut Butter</a>. Victory is mine! We emerged happy with full stomachs. :)

For your morning dose of CPB, you could also add some chocolate chips into the batter along with the sliced bananas and top with regular peanut butter. Aside from tasting delicious, adding peanut butter to your pancakes will help you stay full throughout the morning. Adding chocolate chips will make you feel like you've just eaten dessert for breakfast! It's the perfect weekend splurge.

I hope this post helps any pancake-challenged folks like myself. You're not alone - just take a deep breath and pick up the spatula. You can do it!

<strong>Banana Sour Cream Pancakes</strong>
Yields 6 pancakes
modified from <a href="http://www.barefootcontessa.com/index.shtml">Barefoot Contessa</a>*

1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
½ cup sour cream
¾ cup plus 1 tablespoon milk
2 extra-large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
Vegetable oil, for frying
2 ripe bananas, diced, plus extra for serving
Pure maple syrup
peanut butter & chocolate chips!

1. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk together the sour cream, milk, eggs, vanilla, and lemon zest. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ones, mixing only until combined. 

2. Heat a stainless pan coated with vegetable oil over medium-low. Ladle the pancake batter into the pan. Distribute a rounded tablespoon of bananas (and chocolate chips, if desired) on each pancake. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bubbles appear on top and the underside is nicely browned. Flip the pancakes and then cook for another minute, until browned. Add more vegetable oil to the pan, and continue cooking pancakes until all the batter is used. Serve with sliced bananas, butter, peanut butter and maple syrup.
