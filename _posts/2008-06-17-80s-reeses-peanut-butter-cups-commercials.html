Searching for chocolate and peanut butter on YouTube provides a fun trip down memory lane. Some of these Reese's commercials I remember and some I don't, but they all give you a warm and fuzzy feeling and help you recall just how wonderfully corny the 80s were. Here are a few for you to enjoy:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdtaThCpyPM&feature=related">Nibbler</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQRY0uadv-U&feature=related">Bear</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdtH33KzYoo">Pirate</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWMM7HPeTHQ&feature=related">Movie Theater</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5_gTdqeUOI&feature=related">Video Game</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFb6Mp3hfYE&NR=1">Roger</a>

And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvq_qo05z3w&feature=related">this 1979 commercial</a> is for Reese's Pieces which don't have chocolate, but it was just too ridiculous not to post. 

Unfortunately this YouTube search also finds a lot of gross parodies with phrases like "One wrong way to eat a Reese's". So if you decide to search around yourself, be careful what you click on.

The "Heavenly Goodness" graphic is part of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B8PyRBTs-k">this homemade Reese's Commercial</a>. The commercial is pretty strange but I just couldn't pass on that graphic.
