Well, I am sad to report that my computer is still on the fritz, however we remain hopeful and pray for a swift recovery.

Taste Tester is letting me borrow his computer as I often feel withdrawal when I'm away from the blog. I noticed a CPB recipe in the latest issue of Cooking Light that looks tasty and wanted to share. This bar is a light recreation of a CPB bar made by the chef at <a href="http://www.theswag.com/">The Swag Country Inn</a> in Waynesville, North Carolina. It's packed with peanut butter, lightly salted dry-roasted peanuts, whole-grain flaked cereal (like Total) and drizzled with dark chocolate. 

Can't hop the train to Waynesville to stake out the kitchen where these bars are made? No problem - get the lightened copycat recipe at <a href="http://find.myrecipes.com/recipes/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&recipe_id=1867595">Cooking Light</a>.
