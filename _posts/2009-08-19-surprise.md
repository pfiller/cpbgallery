I love surprises - who doesn't? Returning contributor, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-15101-Grand-Rapids-Dessert-Examiner">Sherry Smith-Noble</a> wrote in with another awesome chocolate peanut butter recipe:  <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-15101-Grand-Rapids-Dessert-Examiner~y2009m8d8-Cupcakes-with-a-surprise-inside">Cupcakes with a Surprise Inside</a>!

The first step is to whip up any chocolate cake batter you like (Sherry recommends <a href="http://justdessertsexaminer.blogspot.com/2009/08/chocolate-cake.html">this one</a>). After filling the cupcake liners with just a little batter, you add a peanut butter cup, then top with some more batter. After they're done baking up, they get topped with fluffy peanut butter frosting. It doesn't end there - you finish em off by garnishing the cupcakes with chopped peanut butter cups. Nice!

For an extra element of surprise, you could also opt for another option besides Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. You could switch it up by trying <a href="http://www.ghirardelli.com/products/squares_peanut_butter.aspx">Ghirardelli's Milk Chocolate with Peanut Butter Squares</a>, <a href="http://www.lindtusa.com/product-exec/product_id/28/category_id//nm/Lindor_Truffles_Peanut_Butter_19_oz_Bag">Lindt's Peanut Butter Lindor Truffles</a>, or <a href="http://www.vosgeschocolate.com/product/organic_peanut_butter_candy_bar/exotic_candy_bars">Vosges Organic Peanut Butter Bonbon Bar</a>. Using a fancy peanut butter treat could add extra elegance to an already enchanting dessert!

Thanks to Sherry to sharing another great recipe!
