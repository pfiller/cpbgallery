I love candy, but there are a few times of year that I <em>really</em> get in the mood for it. Halloween is an obvious one, Christmas, Valentine's Day of course, and then there's Easter. I'm not sure what it is about egg shaped candy that gets me but I love them all: Russell Stover Eggs (in various flavors), Cadbury Creme Eggs, Cadbury Mini Eggs and as mentioned previously, Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs.

I hit the trifecta this year because I had already enjoyed the <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2010/03/18/the-peanut-butter-egg-to-end-all-peanut-butter-eggs/">gargantuan</a> and <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2010/02/26/reeses-milk-chocolate-peanut-butter-eggs/">normal-sized</a> eggs and when I got to mom's house yesterday, she had an Easter gift for me that was laden with Reese's Mini Eggs. Score!

I wonder if this annual candy craving has anything to do with the fact that I gave up chocolate for Lent for a couple years in a row and when the holiday rolls around it revives the joy I experienced of finally getting to eat candy on Easter day. In honor of this candy love, I'm going to share a few chocolate peanut butter candy posts in a row. I hope you enjoy - stay tuned!
