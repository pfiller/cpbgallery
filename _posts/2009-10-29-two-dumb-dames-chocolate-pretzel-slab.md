While spending a good amount of time in the car on our road trip a couple weeks ago, Taste Tester and I decided to count how many states we'd been to. After tallying him at 34 and me at 25, we decided to add another new one to the list: Arkansas. It was only a short drive away from where we were staying in Springfield, MO so we decided to take a day trip there. After getting some recommendations on various cities and parks to visit, we chose Eureka Springs. It's a quaint town that's got a similar vibe to Woodstock, NY (if you're a north-easterner). The difference is that it's larger and there are tons of awesome Victorian houses scattered all over the place.

Somehow I didn't get any pictures of the adorable Victorians - probably because I was too busy ogling them as we drove by, but here are a few shots of the nice downtown:

Though his wife recommended it, Shawn was a little hesitant to send us to Eureka Springs with the stipulation that the downtown is mostly full of quilt stores. While we can confirm that you can find many a quilt there, you will also find other fun little shops including this well-stocked candy shop called <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/two-dumb-dames-fudge-factory-eureka-springs">Two Dumb Dames</a>. The large fudge selection takes up the left counter in this photo. They also sell lots of classic candies, chocolate-covered nuts, and even t-shirts.

Of their giant fudge selection, I chose the White Chocolate Raspberry Fudge which was delicious (and satisfied <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/09/24/the-perfect-fall-snack/">the white chocolate raspberry kick</a> I seem to be on), but they also had Peanut Butter Fudge, Tiger Fudge (chocolate and peanut butter striped fudge) and Butterfinger Fudge. We instead opted for the Pretzel Explosion - it's an inch thick free-form chocolate treat that included a layer of milk chocolate, caramel, peanut butter, pretzels, another layer of milk chocolate and some white chocolate drizzle. It was basically a homemade version of a Take 5. I loved it. Their milk chocolate wasn't quite as good as the milk chocolate from <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/10/28/the-old-market-candy-shop/">The Old Market Candy Shop</a>, but once you slather it in caramel, peanut butter and pretzels, it's pretty hard to resist.

(Okay so it may not be the most attractive treat ever, you don't get a name like 'Explosion' for being pretty!)
