Apartment Therapy's <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/">The Kitchn</a> was nice enough to do <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/roundup-food-blogs/the-chocolate-peanut-butter-gallery-085722">a great little write-up</a> on The CPB Gallery today. If you haven't checked their site out before, it's a wonderful website who's motto is, "inspiring cooks, nourising homes," and do they ever!

There's definitely someone on board at their HQ that has a chocolate peanut butter sweet tooth, since this isn't the first time they've shown their love of chocolate and peanut butter. In the past they have linked to a great bunch of chocolate peanut butter recipes including:

<a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/slinks/daily-scoop-double-chocolate-peanut-butter-ice-cream-058864">Double Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream</a>
<a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/roundup-food-blogs/good-eats-ovenless-chocolate-cake-062569">Bacon Peanut Butter Chocolate Cupcakes</a>

Check out all their site has to offer and get cookin'! Thanks to Faith at <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/">The Kitchn</a> for the super nice write-up!
