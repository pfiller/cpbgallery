Taste Tester and I spent a beautiful spring day wandering around Herald Square and wouldn't you know it, we came across a little chocolate and peanut butter right on the street. We were quite full from breakfast but that didn't stop us from sampling these cute cookie sandwiches from <a href="http://wichcraftnyc.com/">'wichcraft</a>. 

'wichcraft has multiple cafe locations as well as these convenient stands in various parks throughout the city.

I have enjoyed a few savory sandwiches from 'wichcraft but had never tasted their cookie sandwiches. Unfortunately I think these may be a touch <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/07/cookie-plate-at-wichcrafts-southwest-porch-nyc-bryant-park-midtown-manhattan.html">overrated</a>, but they were good enough for a sweets fix. Taste Tester liked the smooth peanut butter filling, but thought the oats in the peanut butter cookie made for an odd texture. The chocolate sandwich had a strong cocoa flavor with a fudgey dark chocolate frosting in the center. The tasty fillings helped but the cookies themselves were a little too dry and over-sugared.

All in all, I would get them again if I were to pass by a 'wichcraft but in a city with such stellar desserts (not to mention <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2009/04/13/weekend-treats-sightings-in-nyc/">this delicious pb cookie sandwich</a>), don't know that I would seek them out.

At the very least I really enjoy finally getting to taste items I read about on <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/">Serious Eats: New York</a>. If you ever plan on visiting NYC you should definitely do some reading on their site for the latest must-haves in the nyc foodie world. Check it out, because how else will you know when someone opens up a shop that only sells <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2010/03/the-meatball-shop-meat-destination-or-one-trick-pony-lower-east-side-manhattan-opening-review.html">meatballs</a>?
