One of my favorite things about going to cafés is seeing what interesting and unusual latte flavors they offer, as well as the goofy names baristas like to give them. But since I now work from home and no longer pass a dozen coffee shops on my commute, I started making them myself.

This latte contains some of my favorite things: chocolate hazelnut spread, peanut butter, honey and soymilk. I call it the Honey Bear. Maybe because I love it so much, it deserved a pet name? Or maybe because chocolate and peanut butter are brown like bears? …who eat honey? I don't know what I'm saying anymore, but there's lots of greatness to this drink:

&#8226; <strong>It packs some protein</strong> from soymilk, peanut butter and hazelnuts.
&#8226; <strong>It's sweetened naturally</strong> with honey, a great match for pb.
&#8226; <strong>It's not too heavy</strong>, satisfying your sweet tooth without weighing you down.
&#8226; <strong>It will keep you going</strong> with extra espresso and filling protein.

I have been trying to perfect fancy latte drinks for a little while now. My favorite drink changes regularly, but this is the flavor of the week. Recipe after the break. Enjoy!

<strong>Honey Bear Latte</strong>
Yields 1, just for you!
<strong><em>Special equipment: espresso-maker and milk frother</em>*</strong>

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
2 shots of espresso (prepared via <a href="http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm">aeropress</a> but I assume any method would work)
1 Tbsp honey
1 1/2 tsp <a href="http://justinsnutbutter.com/products.php">Justin's Classic Peanut Butter</a>
1 1/2 tsp <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/p-107-hey-hey-hazelnut-chocolate-hazelnut-spread.aspx">Askinosie Chocolate Hazelnut Spread</a>**
1/2 cup unsweetened soymilk, steamed (not boiled)

<strong>Directions</strong>
1. In your mug, combine espresso, honey, peanut butter and chocolate spread. Froth (or whisk) until thoroughly blended.

2. Froth your steamed soymilk and pour over top. Enjoy while warm. 

*If you are a coffee drinker and don't currently own a frother, I highly recommend you nab one. Being able to make café-style drinks in your home is a great treat, and frothers are not expensive. Since we are traveling this month, I purchased this handy compact <a href="http://www.aerolatte.com/purchase1.html">aerolatte</a> which even has it's own travel case. Neat!

**Askinosie Chocolate Hazelnut Spread is very dark and bittersweet. If you are replacing it with something sweeter like Nutella, omit or go easy on the honey.
