Thanks for all of the well-wishes on the cookbook! I am pretty crazy excited about it so it's hard to keep quiet on details. I can divulge that it will be out in a few months (yay!) but that's about all I've got for you right now. More info soon, I promise!

Again, sorry for the slow and infrequent posts, but I really am working my butt off on the book at the moment. I will be back in fine blogging form in a few short weeks. In other exciting work-related news, I will be working at <a href="http://www.specialtyfood.com/fancy-food-show/">The Fancy Food Show</a> for the first time (fun!) this weekend at the <a href="https://www.askinosie.com/">Askinosie Chocolate</a> booth. I've attended the show as a spectator the last couple of years, so this will be a much different experience. I will even get to attend the <a href="http://www.specialtyfood.com/sofi/">Sofi Awards</a> since they won a silver for their <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/p-66-soconusco-white-chocolate-nibble-bar-85g3-oz.aspx">White Chocolate Nibble Bar</a> and are up for a gold. Congrats to them!! They 100% deserve it. Also, a new product that I designed the label for - <a href="https://www.askinosie.com/p-107-askinosie-chocolate-hazelnut-spread.aspx">Chocolate Hazelnut Spread</a>, whoa! - will be at the show, but if you're not going to be there, you can check it out <a href="https://www.askinosie.com/p-107-askinosie-chocolate-hazelnut-spread.aspx">right on Askinosie's website</a>.

Since I'll be busy this weekend and won't be able to post new blog entries, I'm thinking of tweeting about all the chocolate and peanut butter that I find throughout the show. You can follow me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/cpbgallery">@cpbgallery</a> for the latest in CPB right from the Javits center in NYC!

Oh and in thanks for your awesomeness, I have a coupon code to share courtesy of another wonderful confectioner & exhibitor at the FFS, <a href="http://www.jers.com/">Jer's Chocolates</a>. If you fancy yourself a true CPB addict and haven't tried Jer's yet, what are you waiting for?? They make award-winning chocolate peanut butter bars that I can say from my own gluttonous experiences are quite delicious. Their line of products varies in shape, texture and spice but one thing is always constant: the glorious ever-presence of chocolate and peanut butter. In the words of Carrie Bradshaw, "Hello, lover." 

I've tasted all varieties of Jer's <a href="http://www.jers.com/prod_detail_list/peanut_butter_bars">Gourmet Peanut Butter Bars</a> and <a href="http://www.jers.com/prod_detail_list/peanut_brittle_bites">Brittle Bites</a> and can attest to their awesomeness. I remember being particularly fond of the very indulgent <a href="http://www.jers.com/product/59/peanut_butter_bars">CaraMella</a> and the wonderfully crunchy <a href="http://www.jers.com/product/58/peanut_butter_bars">Toffee Break</a>. 

Ready to order? Just enter the coupon code at checkout to receive a 20% discount (valid through the end of July). The coupon code is: <strong>hrblog</strong>

Happy eating and thanks to Jer's for sharing the chocolate peanut butter love! <3
