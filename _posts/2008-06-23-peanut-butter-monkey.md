How adorable is this? It was made for a kid but as an adult I could eat it too, right? Right?!

This crazy cute sandwich was created as an entry for <a href="http://belladia.typepad.com/crafty_crow/2008/06/crafty-crow-3-m.html">The Crafty Crow Funny Food Contest</a>. Unfortunately the contest ended yesterday but I think it's still worth checking the blog out for the voting process / winner announcement. It says there is public voting from June 24 through the 26th and you don't have to enter the contest to vote. I know who I'm rooting for!

Making food that looks as cute as this monkey sandwich is a great way to have fun in the kitchen with your kids. So invite your kids into the kitchen and get creative.
