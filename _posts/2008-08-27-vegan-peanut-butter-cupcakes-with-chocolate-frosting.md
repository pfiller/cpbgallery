It's been a while since I paid homage to the vegan community. Sorry it took me so long, but this one is for you guys!

Even though I'm not a vegan, I own the fabulous cookbook, <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/1569242739/002-0508011-9314438">Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World</a>, which is a must-own for any cupcake lover no matter if you're a carnivore, herbivore...whatever. The only issue I had with <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/1569242739/002-0508011-9314438">VCTOTW's</a> peanut butter cupcakes (and this isn't the book's fault) was that the recipe contains flax, which Taste Tester can't eat. The problem was that we didn't know he couldn't eat flax until he took a few bites and ended up in pain for the following few hours. And he didn't even get to eat a whole cupcake. Such a shame.

So I was thrilled to find this delicious looking <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashdmarcin/2794620810/">Vegan Peanut Butter Cupcake with Chocolate Frosting</a> that doesn't contain any tree nuts, seeds or any other funky ingredient that might prevent me from making them (and torturing him). 

Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashdmarcin/">ashdmarcin</a> was nice enough to post the recipe to accompany this drool-worthy photo. She notes, "I sincerely believe this is the best treat I've ever baked. Not too sweet -- but dense and moist . . . and the frosting is SO good." 

This cupcake is now at the top of my "MUST BAKE" list. Get the recipe <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashdmarcin/2794620810/">here</a>.
