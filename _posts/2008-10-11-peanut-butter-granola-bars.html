I saw this recipe for <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/peanut-butter-granola-bars?autonomy_kw=peanut%20butter&rsc=header_22">Peanut Butter Granola Bars</a> on MarthaStewart.com and was kind of caught off guard by it. I was expecting the typical health conscious granola bar full of dried fruits, nuts and seeds, glued together with honey or corn syrup. I think this recipe is misnamed, because it's essentially a peanut butter rice krispie treat that you mix some granola into. Not a bad idea, but certainly not a health food snack as the title might lead you to believe.

However once I got past the misnomer I actually think this sounds tasty. I'd have to find a nut and seed free granola that Taste Tester could eat, but I think it's a great way to give Rice Krispie treats a bit more protein, substance and multilayered flavor.

I also really enjoy recipes that are easy to switch up. You could easily use chocolate rice krispies or cocoa puffs for this, add chocolate chips, peanut butter m&ms, use <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/detail_17010006__4.html">Peanut Butter and Co's Dark Chocolate Dreams Peanut Butter</a> instead of regular pb, etc. Take a look at what you have in your pantry and see what you come up with!

If you need some advice on what granola to use, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.milkandhoneygranola.com/">my all-time favorite granola by Milk & Honey Cafe</a> in Chicago or <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/05/04/review-erin-bakers-peanut-butter-and-double-chocolate-chunk-granolas/">Erin Baker's Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chunk Granolas</a> which are great as well.
