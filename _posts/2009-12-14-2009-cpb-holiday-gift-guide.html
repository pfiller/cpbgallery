I was hoping to get this gift guide up a little sooner, but thankfully you still have some time to order your gifts and have them sent off for the holidays! (At least if it's too late, you can always bookmark this page and save it for Valentine's Day.)

It's no secret that over the last year, I've tasted some pretty amazing chocolate peanut butter products. Here's a list of some tasty treats that will help you pick holiday gifts for all of the special cpb-loving-people in your life. 

In addition to the chocolate and peanut butter ideas, I'm also including some goodies from companies that I've had the opportunity of working with this year. They've helped make it a fun year for me and I'm proud to have contributed to their amazing products!

<a href="http://www.izzybellechocolate.com/pages/shoponline.html">Izzybelle Chocolate Sauce with Peanut Butter</a>
Seriously chocolatey and lusciously smooth, Izzybelle's CPB sauce is great on ice cream, as filling for cookies, straight out of the jar or whatever way you like it. Get a jar (or two, or ten!) at <a href="http://www.izzybellechocolate.com/pages/shoponline.html">Izzybelle Chocolate</a>.

<a href="https://www.askinosie.com/p-95-peppermint-bark.aspx">Askinosie Chocolate's Peppermint Bark</a>
We all know how much I love these guys. I had the pleasure of designing their holiday gift box this year, which is a festive wood-burned birch box filled with their ridiculously minty / crunchy / tasty / delicious Peppermint Bark! Buy some at <a href="https://www.askinosie.com/p-95-peppermint-bark.aspx">Askinosie</a>. You could also get a tube of their amaaaaazing <a href="https://www.askinosie.com/p-92-single-origin-natural-cocoa-powder-davao-philippines.aspx">cocoa powder</a> to use for your holiday baking.

Just thinking about Peanut Butter & Co's adorable peanut butter sandwich shop makes me smile. Their brittle makes a great stocking-stuffer, but if you're in the market for a new jar peanut butter, their <a href="http://ilovepeanutbutter.com/index.php/peanutbutter/peanut-butter/whitechocolatewonderful.html">White Chocolate Wonderful</a> & <a href="http://ilovepeanutbutter.com/index.php/peanutbutter/peanut-butter/thebeesknees.html">The Bee's Knees</a> are both crave-worthy.

<a href="http://www.jers.com/product/65/peanut_butter_bars">Jer's Cara Mella Bar</a>
It was almost overwhelmingly joyous to discover a company that only makes chocolate peanut butter products. Hello, were we meant to be or what? I've tasted many of their delicious chocolates but if I had to pick, I think the <a href="http://www.jers.com/product/59/peanut_butter_bars">Cara Mella</a> might be my fave.

<a href="http://www.choclatique.com/product.php?cat_id=20&product_id=66">Choclatique's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Drinking Mix</a>
I've really enjoyed having this drink mix stuff stowed away in my pantry. It's the perfect thing to curl up on the couch with on a chilly day. It only takes a couple short minutes to whip up and before you know it, you're sipping on some wonderfully rich peanut butter cocoa.

<a href="http://www.fishseddy.com/browse.cfm/4,855.html">Fishs Eddy's Brooklynese Cawffee Mug</a>

Finally, one of my favorite gifts to give people is the homemade kind. Try whipping up a batch of <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Peanutty-Chocolate-Fudge/Detail.aspx">Peanutty Chocolate Fudge</a>, <a href="http://www.landolakes.com/mealideas/ViewRecipe.cfm?RecipeID=13377">Chocolate Peanut Butter Shortbread</a> or <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/recipes/recipes/detail.asp?id=4981&ICID=KH1023&ICAMP=true">Chocolate & Peanut Butter Truffles</a>. Wrapping gifts and making cards is half the fun of giving gifts (at least for me), so don't be afraid to get creative! If you need suggestions, check out <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/wrap-it-up">Martha Stewart's extensive list of holiday gift wrapping ideas</a>.

Whatever you end up giving and receiving this year, I hope you have a wonderfully delicious holiday season!
