After eating that fantastic <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kstar810/3437335059/">Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookie</a> from the <a href="http://www.treatstruck.com/">Treats Truck</a>, I had to make a batch myself - one wasn't enough! I didn't even have to make filling for the insides of the sandwich cookies because I had two jars of <a href="http://www.izzybellechocolate.com/pages/shoponline.html">Izzybelle Chocolate Sauce</a> on hand.

Here's their <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/B001ULWAHY">Chocolate Peanut Butter Sauce</a>:

and their <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/B001ULUMCO">Chilli Cinnamon Chocolate Sauce</a>:

I really enjoy reading the backstory of the companies I've become acquainted with through this blog. Izzybelle is a family affair and you can tell by reading their <a href="http://www.izzybellechocolate.com/pages/ourcompany.html">story</a> that they really take pride in their product and truly love making (and eating!) chocolate sauce. Their journey from home kitchen to the big leagues started with selling the chocolate sauces at their local holiday market and has included thirty years of kitchen experiments. Their dedication certainly paid off! 

You know I have a weakness for chocolate-related design. Of their packaging, the company states: 


<blockquote>Our Earth already holds too much "stuff" (read that as litter!) We have made a decision to bottle our sauce in simple but attractive glass jars with lug lids, in the hope that our customers will find numerous ways to recycle our packaging. We also have designed our gift packs to look enticing and be strong enough to be re-used many times before being discarded.</blockquote>



I think this is a really respectful approach. Re-filling the jar with another delicious treat also makes it easier to cope with that empty feeling inside when you run out of these delicious sauces!

Speaking of the sauces, here's what they had to say about their process:


<blockquote>We make it ourselves with New Mexico peanuts ground into peanut butter by another local vendor. Our sauce is made with local, natural and organic ingredients and ScharffenBerger 70% dark chocolate and natural cocoa. They are also gluten-free and low calorie. </blockquote>



You really can taste the quality of the chocolate they use. The sauces are so rich and divine that you know they're not using any average ingredients. I'm honestly not sure I've ever tasted jarred chocolate sauce as good as these.

The Chocolate Peanut Butter Sauce is rich and thick and holds it's shape really well, which would be useful if you're using as a topping for cupcakes, or in this case as cookie filling.

After tasting the Chocolate Peanut Butter Sauce, I opened the Chilli Cinnamon Sauce. Oh, the Chilli Cinnamon... I actually thought I was going to melt in my chair upon tasting it. It's super luscious, with a thinner consistency than the PB Sauce. I'll admit that I ate some of it straight from the jar (how could you resist?) and it tasted like I was eating the soft, smooth inside of a truffle. It has a wonderfully sweet and spicy flavor. If eating it straight from the jar was this good, I can only imagine how great it would be over a brownie sundae. Mmmmmmmm...

You can see the difference in consistency between the sauce in this pic and the one above:

If you decide to use the sauces as filling for these peanut butter cookies, I recommend you use the Chocolate Peanut Butter Sauce. Maybe that goes without say, but I made a couple with the Chilli Cinnamon Sauce just out of curiosity. The PB won out, so I think I'll save the Chilli Cinnamon for brownies (or maybe just for a spoon!).

If you're not up for making cookies, <a href="http://www.izzybellechocolate.com/">Izzybelle</a> recommends you try their Chocolate Peanut Butter Sauce in a variety of ways:
&#8226; Drizzle it onto fresh or frozen bananas
&#8226; Mix a teaspoon of it into a glass of cold milk to make pb chocolate milk
&#8226; Try it over chocolate sorbet or butter pecan ice cream
&#8226; Drizzle it onto fresh baked bran muffins

Buy Izzybelle Chocolate Sauces from <a href="http://www.izzybellechocolate.com/pages/shoponline.html">their website</a> or from <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20">amazon</a>.

<strong>Creamy Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies w/ Izzybelle Chocolate Sauce</strong>
modified from <a href="http://www.lovintheoven.com/2009/04/creamy-peanut-butter-cookies.html">Lovin' From the Oven</a>
Yield: 12 sandwich cookies

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
3/4 cup peanut butter
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
extra sugar for rolling
<a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thechocolatpe-20/detail/B001ULWAHY">Izzybelle Chocolate Peanut Butter Sauce</a>, for filling

<strong>Directions</strong>
1. Preheat oven to 350&#176;. Line cookie sheets with parchment.

2. Beat together the butter, peanut butter, and vanilla extract. Mix in both sugars, salt, and baking powder. Gradually mix in the flour, half at a time. Beat in the eggs, one at a time.

3. Roll into 1 1/2 inch balls and then roll the balls into sugar. Using a fork, flatten the cookie and make a criss-cross pattern. Bake for 12-13 minutes. They will be firm to the touch and have a barely noticeable brown edge. Let cookies cool on the cookie sheet after taking them out for about 8 minutes before removing them with a spatula. Cool completely before storing or filling.

4. Fill the cookies with a generous amount of Izzybelle Chocolate Peanut Butter Sauce, using at least a heaping tablespoon per sandwich.

These cookies are super soft and taste even better the next day!
