A lot of people out there like to wind down at the end of a long hectic week with friends and a drink in hand. But while others mull over some crappy beer, you and your tastebuds can dance the night away with a delicious Peanut Butter Cup Martini.

<a href="http://www.beverageworld.com/content/view/33583/171/">Beverage World</a> claims that "there is only one peanut butter based spirits product in the US," and it's called <a href="http://www.castriescreme.com/">Castries Peanut Rum Creme</a>. It's made of Madagascan vanilla, roasted peanuts, spices, cream and St. Lucian rum. You can read a review of it on <a href="http://scottesrum.com/2007/09/30/castries-peanut-rum-creme/">Scotte's Rum Pages</a>. It is summed up as "an exquisite liqueur, with an outstanding balance of tastes." Sounds good to me!

I think discovering this liquor has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for chocolate and peanut butter beverages... 

Recipe after the break. It is from <a href="http://www.polishedpalate.com/events/cocktails/castries.html">The Polished Palate</a>.
