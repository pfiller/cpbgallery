Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elfcakes/">mmmm, brains</a> aka blogger <a href="http://www.mmmmbrains.com/blogg/">mmmm, brains</a> is entering this cake into a contest. If I were a judge, she'd sure have my vote. This cake looks so intense. Even the brownie bottom has peanut butter chips in it! 

I'm reposting the recipe because I can't link directly to it on her blog, but <a href="http://www.mmmmbrains.com/archives/2007_03.html#001218">this is the page</a> it came from, you just have to scroll for it.

<strong>Peanut Butter Cup Brownie Bottom Cheesecake</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Brownie Crust</strong><br>
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips<br>
1 cup peanut butter chips<br>
6 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted <br>
1-1/4 cups sugar <br>
1 Tbsp vanilla extract (I used Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla)<br>
2 eggs <br>
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour <br>
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa<br>
1/2 tsp baking powder <br>
1/2 tsp salt<br>
<br>
<strong>Cheesecake Filling</strong><br>
2 lbs cream cheese, softened<br>
5 eggs, at room temperature <br>
1-1/2 cups firmly packed brown sugar <br>
1 cup smooth peanut butter (not natural-style) <br>
1/2 cups whipping cream <br>
1 Tbsp vanilla extract <br>
6 peanut butter cups, cut into quarters<br>
<br>
(this made too much batter for me. Not sure how to cut down the portions. I was able to make an extra very slim 7" cheesecake with the leftover batter. So less than half was left over...)<br>
<br>
<strong>Decoration</strong><br>
6 peanut butter cups, cut carefully in half<br>
1/2 cup whipping cream<br>
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips<br>
1 cup peanut butter cups<br>
<br>
(this makes a lot more than you'll need for decorative purposes. I plan on using the extra to serve with the individual slices)<br>
<br>
<strong>Directions</strong><br>
1. Heat oven to 350°F. Grease 9-inch springform pan with butter.<br>
2. Stir together butter, sugar and vanilla in large bowl with spoon or wire whisk. Add eggs; stir until well blended. Stir in flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; blend well. Spread in prepared pan.<br>
3. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until brownie begins to pull away from side of pan. Meanwhile make cheesecake layer (see below).<br>
4. Immediately after removing brownie from oven, sprinkle milk chocolate chips, peanut butter chips and peanut butter cups over brownie surface. Spoon cheesecake mixture over chips. Turn down oven 325°.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cheesecake Filling</strong><br>
5. Beat cream cheese in bowl of electric mixer until smooth.<br>
6. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.<br>
7. Add sugar, peanut butter and cream; mix until smooth.<br>
8. Stir in vanilla.<br>
9. Pour filling into prepared crust.<br>
<br>
[I had extra batter that I put in a smaller springform pan at this point]<br>
<br>
10. Double-wrap springform pan with aluminum foil to prevent water seeping in.<br>
11. Place springform pan into a larger baking pan.<br>
12. Pour hot water into the larger pan so that the water comes 1 inch up the sides of the springform pan.<br>
13. Bake at 325 degrees 1-1/2 hours, or until firm and lightly browned.<br>
14. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for one hour.<br>
15. Run a knife along the edge of the cake to loosen it from the pan somewhat.<br>
16. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before decorating. I tend to make cheesecakes a day ahead to let things set.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cheesecake tip:</strong> to get the cake off the bottom of the springform pan, because most crusts have butter in them, you just need to heat up the bottom of the pan a bit and the cake should come off easily. I remove the sides, then hold the pan over a burner on my stove - set to LOW - for about 15 or so seconds. Whatever you can handle. Then run a long cake spatula under the cake and it should slip easily off the pan. Just be careful - the bottom of the cake is now very slippery.<br>
<br>
17. Remove cake from pan and put on a pretty plate.<br>
18. Bring whipping cream to boil in a small saucepan.<br>
19. Remove from heat and add semi-sweet and peanut butter chips. Stir, stir, stir until melted and smooth.<br>
20. Drizzle over cake and then add peanut butter cup halves around the edge of the cake.
