Reminder #1: I had another bagel this morning with <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/24/chocolate-peanut-butter-cream-cheese-spread/">Chocolate Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Spread</a>. Delicious. Have I convinced you to make this yet? I hope so.

It's disappearing all too quickly!...

Reminder #2: The first edition of The Chocolate Peanut Butter Exhibition has a deadline that quickly approaches! Monday is your last day to enter your best peanut butter cookie recipe. If you want full contest details check them out in my <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/15/the-great-peanut-butter-exhibition/">previous post</a>, or read about it on <a href="http://www.peanutbutterboy.com/2008/04/great-peanut-butter-exhibition-1.html">Peanut Butter Boy</a> and <a href="http://www.foodaphilia.com/2008/04/peanut-butter-exhibition.html">Foodaphilia</a> (submit your entry to Peanut Butter Boy). The three of us have been enjoying receiving some truly fantastic entries. It will surely be hard to choose a winner. Thanks to all those who have participated! And those of you that haven't, you have til Monday, so get baking!

And can you tell I'm enjoying the camera? :P
