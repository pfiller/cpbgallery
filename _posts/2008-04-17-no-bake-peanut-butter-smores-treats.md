In honor of <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/15/the-great-peanut-butter-exhibition/">The Great Peanut Butter Exhibition</a>, I decided to do a little peanut butter cookie experimentation in my kitchen last night. Though, I didn't quite have the patience to sit there putting batch after batch of cookies into the oven, so I made some easy no-bake cookies instead. The result was yummy, though I'm not totally sure they can be called cookies. They're kind of a mix of a candy and cookie, so for lack of argument, I'm just going to call them a treat.

The texture is similar to a chocolate coconut cluster, which by the way I LOVE. And for those of you who do not love the texture of coconut (yeah I know you're out there) don't fret, it's not that stringy get-stuck-in-your-teeth coconut texture - it's got the same fine-ness, but it's crumbly. So biting into one of these was heavenly for me. And you get the nice surprise of a marshmallow filling. Well it's not so surprising if you're the one that's made them, but you can pretend to be surprised. The cinnamon - as Rachel Ray would say - "adds that little something extra that makes ya go, 'hmmm! what is that?!'"

These are made with <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/02/two-new-peanut-butter-co-peanut-butters/">honey peanut butter</a> because I am obsessed with it lately. If you don't have it you should really pick yourself up a jar, because it's fantastic. Until you do, if you want to make these, you can just use regular peanut butter. 

For those of you that don't know about The Great Peanut Butter Exhibition, find out about it <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/15/the-great-peanut-butter-exhibition/">here</a> and get baking (or "no-baking," in my case)!

<strong>No-Bake Peanut Butter S'mores Treats</strong>
Yields 19 Treats

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
1 cup Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/detail_17010007__4.html">The Bee's Knees Honey Peanut Butter</a>
2 cups graham crackers, crushed (about 16 graham cracker sheets)
57 mini marshmallows (about 3/4 cup)
1/4 tsp cinnamon

Directions
1. Melt chocolate chips and peanut butter over a double boiler. Blend with a spoon - this mixture is like sludge, don't bother with a wimpy old whisk!
2. Remove from heat and stir cinnamon and graham crackers into the melted mixture.
3. Using a silicone mini-mini muffin mold*, press enough of the chocolate mixture into the mold to coat the bottom and sides of a cup. Place three mini marshmallows in the center and top with more of the chocolate mixture. Press as much of the mixture into the mold as you can so the treat is dense and comes out of the mold easily. Repeat for each treat and let cool until set. Pop the treats out of the molds and enjoy!

*I wouldn't recommend using any other mold beside silicone. If you don't have that type, you can try lining a regular mini muffin tin with paper liners. I haven't tried this though, so I take no responsibility for the results!
