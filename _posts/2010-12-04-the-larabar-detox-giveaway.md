This time of year is easily the hardest to stay healthy... and I've been a bad, bad girl.

The holiday season is always filled with lots of get-togethers. Said get-togethers are generally well-stocked with delicious but bad-for-you desserts. When the gatherings end, everyone inevitably cites their imposing diet as the reason why they can't take leftovers home. I watch my weight too but you think I'd let a dessert go wasted? Sacrilege! And before I know it, my house is filled with temptation. Delicious, delicious temptation.

I started every day last week eating leftover pastries from somewhere or another and surprise surprise, put on a couple pounds. This week I sang a slightly different tune, with the help of the nice folks at <a href="http://www.larabar.com/home">LÄRABAR</a>. They shared with me some of their tasty good-for-you products. I'm thankful to them both for the slight cleanse they have bestowed upon me and because the flavors still seem indulgent without the consequences. Win / win.

There is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdRLYqP7ZoM">a promotional campaign for Yoplait yogurt</a> - maybe you've seen it - the one where people describe how much of this cake and that cake they've been eating, all the while losing weight because they are eating the Yoplait version of their favorite desserts instead of the actual calorie-laden versions they are used to. I feel like LÄRABAR fits into the same category. Their bars have indulgent names like <a href="http://www.larabarstore.com/detail/LAR+45311">Coconut Cream Pie</a>, <a href="http://www.larabarstore.com/detail/LAR+45339">Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough</a> and <a href="http://www.larabarstore.com/detail/LAR+45313">Cinnamon Roll</a>. Somehow, even though I'm eating something healthy that doesn't weigh me down, I still walk away from breakfast mentally feeling as though I've treated myself.

I tried a few and some bars tasted more like their namesakes than others (see the full list of flavors <a href="http://www.larabarstore.com/">in their online store</a>). I thought Coconut Cream Pie was really Coconut-Cream-Pie-ish while Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough was good but would have been a little harder to guess had I been blind-folded while eating it. The dominant flavor in a lot of the bars is dates (which makes sense since it's the first ingredient in a lot of them). The dates lend a nice fruity and moist background to the bars and compliment the chocolate in the chocolate-flavored bars. It's a nice break from other brands of bars that taste dry or powdery by comparison. I also think it's cool that they make such tasty treats with such a short list of very healthy ingredients. For example, the list for <a href="http://www.larabarstore.com/detail/LAR+43265">Peanut Butter & Jelly</a> is merely "dates, peanuts, unsweetened cherries and salt." And it tastes remarkably like a PB&J. Pretty cool! 

Their brand mission states that, "LÄRABAR firmly believes that the foundation of a sound mind, body and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is healthiest and most satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state." Sounds like they've achieved that!
