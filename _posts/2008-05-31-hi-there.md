Sorry folks, but I am taking the weekend off. My allergies are kicking my butt and I am enjoying lazing about far too much. I love spring, but my nose hates it. Stupid nose. 

Luckily I made some <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/02/17/chocolate-peanut-butter-cocoa-krispie-treats-2/">Chocolate Peanut Butter Cocoa Krispie Treats</a> the other day so I have those to keep me company.

See you on Monday! :)
