Like most kids, I ate a lot of peanut butter & jelly sandwiches. Little did I know that this was a good thing for both my tastebuds and for the planet!

<a href="http://www.pbjcampaign.org/">The PB&J Campaign</a> is spreading the world about how eating plant-based meals - specifically the PB&J - is a way to help decrease greenhouse gas emissions as well as water and land usage. And what better day to join in the cause than today, April 2nd, National PB&J Day!

They'll be celebrating live with Whole Foods Markets in Philadelphia (the Callowhill store) and Los Angeles (the Woodland Hills store), and invite you to drop by for a sandwich. If you're not in those areas, whip one up yourself and sink your teeth into this classic, tasty earth-lovin' sammy. Maybe make a second one for a friend while you're at it to share the good eats and help spread the word.
