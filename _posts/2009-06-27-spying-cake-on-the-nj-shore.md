Hi there! That was a longer break than usual for me - sorry!

Despite my absence, I have been up to just as much baking and chocolate peanut butter consumption as usual. I have also been chatting with the wonderful Jessie Oleson of <a href="http://www.cakespy.com/">Cakespy</a> who kindly informed me of some fantastic treats on our very own glorious NJ shore! 

On a recent visit to the east coast, she stopped by an adorable little bakery called The Scone Pony and shortly thereafter posted <a href="http://www.cakespy.com/2009/06/get-sconed-sweet-treats-at-scone-pony.html">a glowing review</a> of their baked goods. In addition to taking a liking to their adorably punny name, she also enjoyed the Peanut Butter Pie w/ Chocolate Ganache Topping (pictured above) and, "A simple but perfect peanut butter cookie sandwich filled with a sweet peanut butter cream (kind of a fancy Nutter Butter)." I think it's safe to say that we have similar tastes!

With the summer just barely kicked off, it's comforting knowing that Taste Tester and I have plenty of time to fit a shore trip into our schedules in order to get our mitts on these precious goodies. 

If by chance you can't make it to the Jersey shore (or if you're a snobbypants and don't 'do Jersey' - whatever!) Jessie also <a href="http://www.cakespy.com/search?updated-max=2009-06-13T11%3A52%3A00-07%3A00&max-results=12">mentioned this fabulous Peanut Butter & Jelly Bar</a> from <a href="http://www.ciaofornow.net/">ciao for now</a> in NYC's East Village:

She notes, "served in thick, dense wedges, this bar is weighty--but oh so rewarding. It all starts with a thick cookie-like crust on top of which is sandwiched a thick layer of peanut butter and a sliver of jelly, which is then all topped with an oaty-nutty-crumbly topping." Say no more - where's my metro card?!! Granted there's no chocolate in the bar, but PB&J is a close cousin of PB&C, so I can make an exception!

Lesson learned: Keep an eye on <a href="http://www.cakespy.com/">Cakespy</a> for yummy cpb treats and of course for those adorable cupcake paintings of hers! Thanks to Jessie for spreading the word about these treats as well as the beautiful photos!
