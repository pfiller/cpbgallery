Maybe I'm crazy, but I feel like sometimes being limited in the kitchen is almost more idea-inspiring than when you have every ingredient on the planet to work with. My kitchen is regularly fully-stocked and yet, often times I stare at the cupboards unable to form a meal plan. How is that possible?

This week I did something that I imagine everyone who loves to eat would probably dread doing: I had my wisdom teeth taken out. You think I'd be crushed from the limitations that brings... no delicious bagels to tear at, no crunchy snacks to munch on, etc.- but instead, my world was opened up to a vast array of <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/asparagus-soup-recipe/index.html">velvety soups full of spring veggies</a>, <a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/organic-scottish-oatmeal.html">Scottish Oatmeal</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whole-living-smoothies/id438772951?mt=8">vibrant smoothies</a> and luscious desserts. Could I make these things before? Sure. Did I? Nope. Inspiration comes from odd places sometimes.

I prepped for my recovery by bookmarking lots of easy-to-eat recipes, including these lovely <a href="http://ilovepeanutbutter.com/recipes/chocolate-peanut-butter-pots-de-creme/">Chocolate Peanut Butter Pots De Crème</a>. Who needs vicodin when you have something that's delicious and full of chocolate and peanut butter? It's also perfect for any of you gluten-free eaters, and a nice avenue for using PB&Co's tasty <a href="http://ilovepeanutbutter.com/darkchocolatedreams.html">Dark Chocolate Dreams Peanut Butter</a> since the flavor of it really comes through nicely.

Note: I like a bit of a skin on my pudding so I didn't put plastic wrap on top right away as the recipe suggests. Mine also came out a little light and foamy-looking on top, I think because of my vigorous whisking.

I guess it's worth mentioning that cooking and blogging are also an excellent distraction from the discomfort. This was a great activity / dessert all around.
