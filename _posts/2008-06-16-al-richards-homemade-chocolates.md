I've <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/04/24/chocolate-peanut-butter-cream-cheese-spread/">mentioned my love of fantastic NY/NJ bagels</a> at least a few times here on The CPB Gallery and when I'm in the northern suburbs of NJ, <a href="http://www.ronniesbagels.com/menu.htm">Ronnie's Bagels</a> is my bagelry of choice. But on my latest trip there, I was welcomed into the store by more than just the sight and smell of some super fresh bagels.

They had a new display of Ronnie's Chocolates which were actually <a href="http://www.alrichardschocolates.com/">Al Richard's Homemade Chocolates</a> in disguise with Ronnie's labels. The display included various items such as Oreos coated in chocolate and M&Ms or peanut butter chips, pretzels coated in chocolate and toffee and more. I of course walked out with the Oreos coated in chocolate and peanut butter chips. Can you see why?

These are pretty damned good. I can only eat half of one at a time because they're so intense. I don't buy Oreos much these days because I have a tendency to make myself ill from overindulging in them, but these were just too hard to resist. 

The next time you find yourself in need of some breakfast dessert after eating a delicious bagel from Ronnies, enjoy an Oreo coated in chocolate and peanut butter chips from <a href="http://www.alrichardschocolates.com/index.htm">Al Richard's Homemade Chocolates</a>. They customize their labels so like Ronnies, you can order up some tasty chocolates branded with your own name or company.

Of course if you can't get your hands on some of these, replicating them at home would be a fun and delicious activities for both kids and adults. Just dip some Oreos (double stuffed might be even better, hehe) in some melted milk chocolate and roll in a dish of peanut butter chips. Another option would be to dip Peanut Butter Stuffed Oreos in milk chocolate and decorate with sprinkles. Then let them sit on wax or parchment paper until set. Of course the homemade ones won't have your very own sweet labels printed on them, but now you know where to go if you want those.
