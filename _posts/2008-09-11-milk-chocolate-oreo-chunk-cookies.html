The idea for these cookies came from the blog <a href="http://www.cookiemadness.net/?p=2222">Cookie Madness</a>. I just kind of glanced at <a href="http://www.cookiemadness.net/?p=2222">the photo and recipe</a> and instantly decided to make them before really reading the post and recipe. When I saw that it was made with Martha Stewart's <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/portal/site/mslo/menuitem.fc77a0dbc44dd1611e3bf410b5900aa0/?vgnextoid=2166fee1bc8b4110VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default&rsc=also_try">Milk Chocolate Cookie</a> recipe I was a little disappointed. Martha's recipe is amazingly good if you are eating the cookies hot straight out of the oven. But they don't keep well at all and as a grazer as opposed to a binger, I like my cookies to last a few days. So I decided to use my old stand-by recipe for Fudge Cookies, which is from page 48 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Fields-Best-Ever-Cookie/dp/0783552661">Mrs. Fields Best Ever Cookie Book</a>. I simply added 8.5 oz of chopped milk chocolate and 11 chopped double stuffed oreos. They are soft and delicious and at the least, you can at least get 3 days out of them.

So why am I posting this recipe when it appears to lack peanut butter? Because it would be very easy to use chopped <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/08/01/peanut-butter-oreos-review/">Peanut Butter Oreos</a> instead or peanut butter chips instead of milk chocolate chunks. They'd be quite delicious that way, so I highly recommend you try it!

And by the way, the key to making a cookie like this that has so much chocolate is to use the highest quality chocolate you can afford. I used <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/p-64-single-origin-natural-cocoa-powder-soconusco-mexico.aspx">Askinosie Cocoa Powder</a> and Ghiradelli Semisweet Chips for the dough and <a href="http://www.fatpigchocolate.com/">Fat Pig Milk Chocolate</a> for the chunks.

Don't you wish you could take a bite?

<strong>Chocolate Cookie</strong>
Yields about 42 cookies
Adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Fields-Best-Ever-Cookie/dp/0783552661">Mrs. Fields Best Ever Cookie Book</a>

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
12 oz semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
2 stick (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
3 large eggs, at room temperature
2 tsp vanilla extract
9 oz milk chocolate chunks
11 double stuffed oreos, quartered

<strong>Directions</strong>

1. Preheat oven to 300Â° and prepare baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. In a double boiler, melt the semisweet chocolate over hot, not simmering water. Set aside to cool slightly. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.

3. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in eggs and vanilla until just combined. Blend in the cooled semisweet chocolate. Blend in the flour mixture until just combined. Mix in the chopped milk chocolate and oreos.

4. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes (mine were ready in 18 exactly) or until just set. Cool on the cookie sheet for one minute, then transfer to racks to cool completely.
