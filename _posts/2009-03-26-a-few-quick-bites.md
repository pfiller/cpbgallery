The above is a teaser for an upcoming post (Chocolate Peanut Butter TWINKIES!). I know I've been slow to write, but promise there are good things to come! Here are a few quick things for now:

&#8226; <strong>PB & Co's Latest Contest!</strong>
I wanted to help spread the word: <a href="http://www.ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter & Co</a> announced that they're extending their National Peanut Month Contest by 2 weeks (!) to make the deadline <strong>April 14th</strong>. Participate in National Peanut Month by sending in a picture (via facebook only) demonstrating just how much you love peanut butter. "Got an idea for a dress made from empty Peanut Butter & Co. jars? Show it to us! Finally ready to make that Dark Chocolate Dreams snowman? Now's your chance." Sweet! Contest details are <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Peanut-Butter-Co/14755220199#/pages/Peanut-Butter-Co/14755220199?v=app_10442206389&viewas=17402671">here</a>.

&#8226; <strong>Girl Scout Cookies from now through May in NYC!</strong>
If you don't happen to know any girl scouts, you can still run around on a <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2008/03/06/girl-scout-tagalongs-vs-reeses-cookies/">Tagalong</a> sugar high! According to <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/03/buy-girl-scout-cookies-at-the-cookie-cupboard-nyc-manhattan.html">Serious Eats</a> there is a magical Girl Scout cookie palace called The Cookie Cupboard. I'm picturing that it's like something out of Alice and Wonderland, where you open a small cabinet door and it reveals this secret magical world of endless mounds of delicious cookies. They claim it's just your average building, but I'll stick with my version since it's much more fun. This magical cookie wonderland is located at 43 W 23rd Street in NYC and has limited hours. Visit <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/03/buy-girl-scout-cookies-at-the-cookie-cupboard-nyc-manhattan.html">Serious Eats</a> for more info.

&#8226; <strong>Yummy Recipe of the Day!</strong>
<a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/peanut-butter-and-chocolate-biscotti-recipe/index.html">Chocolate Peanut Butter Biscotti</a>! Rated 5 stars on <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/peanut-butter-and-chocolate-biscotti-recipe/index.html">Food Network</a>. There's peanut butter in the dough and the cookies are studded with chocolate chunks and roasted peanuts. These would make a truly excellent dipper in your morning cuppa.

Happy Thursday! More bigger, longer, picture-filled posts soon!
