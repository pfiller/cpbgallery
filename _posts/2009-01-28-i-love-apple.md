Hey everyone that was on the edge of their seat about the fate of my computer! Well none of you probably were, but since I wrote about it before, I thought I'd follow up: Apple fixed my computer! Apparently it needed a new logic board, which Taste Tester translated as being the brain of the computer. It's new name: Frankenputer. 

I also cleared a bunch of stuff off it which leaves room for much more chocolate and peanut butter-related data! Yay!
