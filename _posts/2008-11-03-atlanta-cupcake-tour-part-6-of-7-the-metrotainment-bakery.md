Alas, the cupcake tour is coming to an end all too quickly. Le Sigh.

691 14th Street, Atlanta GA 30318

<strong>TREATS TASTED:</strong>
1. Red Velvet Cupcake
2. Chocolate Chip Cookie

If you are planning on visiting the Metrotainment Bakery sometime soon, make note of the following message on their site: "Because of our unprecendented growth, we are moving into a new production facility - our current retail space will temporarily close on Friday, October 17. We will be opening a new retail location in November. Until then, you can pick up our award-winning cakes and sweets at a Metrotainment Cafe's Restaurant near you."

It's a good thing that they're moving because their previous location basically looked like a loading zone with a bakery sign slapped on it - not exactly an inviting storefront.

Metrotainment sells a Peanut Butter Cookie but we chose to taste their Chocolate Chip Cookie instead. It was a fine choice because the cookie was real good. Even Ryan, one of our resident Atlanta tasters, who doesn't have a crazy sweet tooth like us really enjoyed it and kept suggesting that we head back to Metrotainment to pick up some more. It kind of reminded me of those soft traditional italian chocolate chip cookies (that I LOVE) but was somehow instead of being crumbly, it was a pretty chewy cookie. It was a really unique combination. This was a cookie I could eat every day. Sorry I don't have a picture of it for you, but some treats meet their doom before they get their beauty shots taken. 

The above photo is of the Red Velvet cupcake which was quite pretty, but didn't even score in the same league as the chocolate chip cookie. The cream cheese frosting was real smooth and tasty but the cake was totally dry. It's sad because it tried so hard with it's cute red heart decoration, but pretty does not always equal tasty.

Metrotainment also offers a Peanut Butter Mousse Cake which is a dark chocolate cake filled with light peanut butter mousse, topped with chocolate ganache and chopped peanuts. Sounds pretty dang good, however a reviewer on Yelp noted that they, "recently had a slice of peanut butter and chocolate cake from here. It wasn't good at all, despite how appealing that combo sounds." This is sad to hear, however this same reviewer also said that the red velvet cake was stellar. So either I caught the red velvet cake on a bad day or this person has no idea what they're talking about. While some of this research has proven inconclusive, one thing I am sure of is that I want another Metrotainment Chocolate Chip Cookie. Yum! 

Sadly, our visit to The Metrotainment Bakery was the last stop on the Atlanta Cupcake Tour. But don't cry, it's not quite over yet! I'll be writing a synopsis next, as promised which will include local restaurants and a bonus feature: other Atlanta cupcakeries suggested by CPB Gallery readers. Stay tuned for the final segment!
