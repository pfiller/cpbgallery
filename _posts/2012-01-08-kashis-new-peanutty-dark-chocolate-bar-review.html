Chocolate and peanut butter are two of my favorite foods, but there's no denying that they can be messy and not always easily transportable. So it's easy to understand why I really love them in "on-the-go" form that you can eat anywhere, anytime!

The travel-friendly new <a href="http://www.kashi.com/products/tlc_layered_granola_bars_peanutty_dark_chocolate">Kashi Peanutty Dark Chocolate Bar</a> fulfills *The CPB Gallery's Official Granola Bar Criteria!*. Woo! See below:

<strong>1) It sticks together.</strong> Seems like a basic enough requirement for a granola bar, right? That is until you find yourself crying over spilled granola, which is just plain sad. Unlike those other more crumbly bars, this bar sticks together well no matter how ferociously you attack it with your chompers. Rawr! 

(If I had a bigger budget, this is the part where I'd show you some black and white footage of some comically inept people weeping uncontrollably as they bite into overwhelmingly messy granola bars. You can pretend right? <em>"Oh, the horror!"</em>)

<strong>2) It doesn't make a monstrous crunch. </strong>Crunchy granola bars that can echo in a quiet room = not good, and if you work in a super quiet office as I once did, you may find yourself having to avoid certain brands. Because getting fired from your job over "Freakishly Loud Chewing" would be well, rather embarrassing. 

<strong>3) It fulfills the craving. </strong>If you're hitting up your on-the-go stash, it's possible that you're out somewhere hungry and/or craving something sweet. Fear not - the whole grains make this bar filling and the thick dark chocolate coating and peanut buttery flavor will surely make your sweet tooth happy. It leans more on the chocolate end for sure, but I'm never one to complain about <em>extra</em> chocolate.

Yup, these pass the test. Go Kashi.

On top of sending me these super tasty bars, I received this way cool pack of Kashi swag. I especially loved the tote with all the healthy suggestions all over it. Lots of good advice.
