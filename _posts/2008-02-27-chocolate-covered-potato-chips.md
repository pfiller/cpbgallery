When I brought these into work one day my co-workers seemed to think I was a little nuts. But maybe the comfort of knowing they'd eaten other, more normal treats I'd created encouraged them to give these a shot. High risk, high reward, right? They were all instantly addicted. The night before Valentine's Day, I was up till 5 in the morning putting together boxes of these so people in the office would have something different to give to their significant others. 

Move over, Godiva. Recipe after the break.

Tip: Before I start, I like to place my potato chips on the prepared baking sheets to make sure there will be room for all of them to lay there once I'm done. There's nothing like scrambling to grab more baking sheets and parchment paper with melted chocolate on your hands, and rushing so your unused melted chocolate doesn't seize up. 

<strong>Chocolate Covered PB Potato Chips</strong>
Yields about 2 dozen depending on the size of your potato chips

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
11 oz Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips (or pre-tempered melting chocolate)
11 oz Reeses peanut butter chips
1-2 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 bag ruffled original potato chips (large enough to get 2-3 dozen whole potato chips out of)
roasted salted peanuts, whole or chopped, for garnish 

<strong>Directions</strong>
1. Before you start, sift through your bag of potato chips and pick out all of the prettiest, most perfect looking ones you can find. Lay out parchment paper on two large baking sheets.
2. Melt the peanut butter chips and 1 Tbsp butter in a double boiler over low heat and whisk until all the chips have melted. If the mixture is too stiff, add more butter to smooth it out. Using a butter knife, carefully spread a layer of the mixture on each potato chip. Let sit 30 minutes or until mostly set.
3. Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler over low heat and whisk until all the chips have melted.
4. Using a slotted spoon or forks, dip the prepared potato chips in the melted chocolate, covering completely. Be gentle so they don't break. Try to wipe dripping chocolate from the bottom of the chip as best you can before laying it on the parchment paper. Garnish with roasted salted peanuts. Let sit until the chocolate is set.

I've attempted chocolate tempering before, and until I figure it out I'm willing to pay a little extra for pre-tempered melting chocolate. If you'd like to give tempering a shot, there are some tips <a href="http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Tempering-Chocolate/Detail.aspx">here</a>.

This recipe can be repurposed to make Chocolate Covered PB Pretzels, which are also fantastic.
