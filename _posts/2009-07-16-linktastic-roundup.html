Well something must have been in the air this week because chocolate and peanut butter made appearances all over the web! Check out these great finds. And thanks to <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/team">Faith</a> at <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/">The Kitchn</a> and Taste Tester for keeping me in the loop!

1. The ever awesome and super tantalizing website, <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/">The Kitchn</a> posted some mouth-watering pictures of a <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/summer/recipe-peanut-butter-ice-cream-with-trader-joes-chocolatecovered-peanut-butter-crackers-089524">Peanut Butter Ice Cream with Trader Joe's Chocolate Covered Mini Peanut Butter Crackers</a>. I would have been too busy popping these crackers into my mouth to think of adding them to ice cream - and homemade ice cream, nonetheless! As someone with a sensitivity to eggs, I especially appreciate the egg-free peanut butter ice cream recipe! Get it <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/summer/recipe-peanut-butter-ice-cream-with-trader-joes-chocolatecovered-peanut-butter-crackers-089524">here</a>!

2. When <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/">Serious Eats</a> tells me to eat something, I don't usually ask questions since their up-to-the-minute food-nerd-happy suggestions are usually right on the money. Things aren't any different this time around. Check out their write-up on the <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/07/cookie-plate-at-wichcrafts-southwest-porch-nyc-bryant-park-midtown-manhattan.html">Cookie Plate from 'wichcraft at the Southwest Porch in Bryant Park</a> which includes an oatmeal, chocolate and a peanut butter sandwich cookie.

3. One of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://thebittenword.typepad.com/thebittenword/">The Bitten Word</a> posted this glorious <a href="http://thebittenword.typepad.com/thebittenword/2009/07/grilled-chocolate-pound-cake-with-homemade-peanut-butter-chococlate-chip-ice-cream.html">Grilled Chocolate Pound Cake with Homemade Peanut Butter Chococlate Chip Ice Cream</a>. This recipe is a delicious amalgamation of recipes from Fine Cooking, Martha Stewart Living and Food & Wine Magazines. Get it <a href="http://thebittenword.typepad.com/thebittenword/2009/07/grilled-chocolate-pound-cake-with-homemade-peanut-butter-chococlate-chip-ice-cream.html">here</a>. 

4. Martha Stewart's <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/cookie-of-the-day?rsc=wn_Homepage_Homepage">Cookie of the Day</a> on Tuesday was <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/peanut-butter-surprise-cookies?lnc=ef2e802fb632c110VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&rsc=cookie+of+the+day_recipe_b">Peanut Butter Surprise Cookies</a>. I've seen variations of this recipe many times before but there's something about their bright, colorful photography that makes me want to bake their version instead.

I hope all of the above suggestions help you to get your daily chocolate peanut butter fix, whether you're running around the nyc, shopping in trader joes, or looking to put that ice cream maker to use!
