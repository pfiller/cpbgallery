It's time to announce the winner of our fabulous <a href="http://www.cpbgallery.com/2010/12/09/askinosie-chocolate-giveaway/">Askinosie Chocolate Giveaway</a>! With record-breaking Chocolate Peanut Butter Gallery reader participation, you guys seriously wanted this stuff! Some of you did a little research and found that <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/How%20We%20Do%20It.aspx">their site outlines their bean-to-bar process</a> of 70 steps. However, some of you realized that it would be a <em>little</em> challenging to fit all 70 steps on a poster, so the language needed to be simplified. What was the number simplified to?

And the lucky number is #17!

Which means our winners are...
<strong>1st Place:</strong> Kathleen for guessing 17 right on the money.
<strong>2nd Place:</strong> Alicia for guessing 15.

Below is a sneak peek of the full soon-to-be-released silkscreened, limited edition poster. The proceeds from this poster will be donated to Askinosie's amazing educational program, <a href="http://www.askinosie.com/Chocolate%20University.aspx">Chocolate University</a>. I'll let you know when it's available incase anyone is interested in helping the cause (and getting a sweet poster in the process!).
